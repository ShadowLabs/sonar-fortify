<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Avoid the WS-Security password type <code>PasswordText</code>.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Using a password type of <code>PasswordText</code> might be an indication that actual passwords are being transmitted in plain text. The WS-Security UsernameToken Profile states that text sent in the UsernameToken <code>&lt;Password&gt;</code> tag are not limited to being actual passwords. They can be password derivatives instead. However, it is common for developers to send actual passwords instead of password derivatives. Sending unencrypted passwords or even password hashes exposes the credentials to anyone with a traffic sniffer.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, a password type of <code>PasswordText</code> is set in the file <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.</p>
