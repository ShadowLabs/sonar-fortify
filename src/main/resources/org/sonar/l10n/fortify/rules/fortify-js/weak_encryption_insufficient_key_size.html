<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An otherwise strong encryption algorithm is vulnerable to brute force attack when a small key size is used.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Current cryptography guidelines suggest that key lengths of at least 1024 bits should be used with the RSA algorithm. However, increased computing power and advances in factoring techniques[1] are challenging the security of 1024 bit RSA encryption.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code generates a 512 bit RSA key.<br /><pre><br />  ...<br />  crmfObject = crypto.generateCRMFRequest(<br />                "CN=" + name.value,<br />                password.value, <br />                authenticator,<br />        	keyTransportCert,<br />                "setCRMFRequest();",<br />                512, null, "rsa-dual-use");<br />  ...<br /></pre><br /><br />When it comes to symmetric encryption, the key lengths should be at least 128 bits.
