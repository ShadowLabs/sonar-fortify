<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The identified function sometimes fails to release a system resource.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br /><p><br />    In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not released.<br /></p><br /><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following method never closes the stream that it reads from. <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />CFIndex numBytes;<br />do {<br />    UInt8 buf[bufferSize]; <br />    numBytes = CFReadStreamRead(readStream, buf, sizeof(buf));<br />    if( numBytes &gt; 0 ) {<br />        handleBytes(buf, numBytes);<br />    } else if( numBytes &lt; 0 ) {<br />        CFStreamError error = CFReadStreamGetError(readStream);<br />        reportError(error);<br />    }<br />} while( numBytes &gt; 0 );<br />...<br /></pre>
