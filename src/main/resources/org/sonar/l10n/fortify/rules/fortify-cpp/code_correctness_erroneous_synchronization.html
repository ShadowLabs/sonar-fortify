<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  If a thread fails to unlock a mutex after signaling other threads, the other threads will remain locked waiting on the mutex.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  After a thread signals other threads waiting on a mutex, it must unlock the mutex by calling <code>pthread_mutex_unlock()</code> before another thread can begin running. If the signaling thread fails to unlock the mutex, the <code>pthread_cond_wait()</code> call in the second thread will not return and the thread will not execute. <br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code signals another thread waiting on a mutex by calling <code>pthread_cond_signal()</code>, but fails to unlock the mutex the other thread is waiting on. <br /><br /><pre><br />   ...<br />   pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;count_mutex);<br /><br />   // Signal waiting thread<br />   pthread_cond_signal(&amp;count_threshold_cv);<br />   ...<br /></pre>
