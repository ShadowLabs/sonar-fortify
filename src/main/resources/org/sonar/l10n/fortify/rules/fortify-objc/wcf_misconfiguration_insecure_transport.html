<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The application configuration should ensure that HTTPS is used for all access to sensitive information.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  If an application handles sensitive information and does not use message-level encryption, then it should only be allowed to communicate over an encrypted transport channel.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, the application is configured with the <code>&lt;httpTransport/&gt;</code> tag in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p>
