<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  <p>The class <Replace key="$fa.field.enclosingClass.name$"/> is annotated as immutable, but field <Replace key="$fa.field.name$"/> is mutated at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/> in file <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/>.</p>
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  This class has been annotated with the annotation Immutable, from the JCIP annotations package. However, one of the mutable fields of the class had a mutating method called on it outside of the constructor and destructor.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code for an immutable final class mistakenly declares a Set <code>public</code> and <code>final</code>.<br /><br /><pre><br />@Immutable<br />public final class ThreeStooges {<br />private final Set stooges = new HashSet>();<br />...<br /><br />public void addStooge(String name) {<br />stooges.add(name);<br />}<br /><br />}<br /></pre>
