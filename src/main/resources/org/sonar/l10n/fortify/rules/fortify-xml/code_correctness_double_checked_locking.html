<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Double-checked locking is an incorrect idiom that does not achieve the intended effect.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Many talented individuals have spent a great deal of time pondering ways to make double-checked locking work in order to improve performance. None have succeeded. <br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> At first blush it may seem that the following bit of code achieves thread safety while avoiding unnecessary synchronization.<br /><br /><pre><br />if (fitz == null) {<br />  synchronized (this) {<br />    if (fitz == null) {<br />      fitz = new Fitzer();<br />    }<br />  }<br />}<br />return fitz;<br /></pre><br /><br />The programmer wants to guarantee that only one <code>Fitzer()</code> object is ever allocated, but does not want to pay the cost of synchronization every time this code is called. This idiom is known as double-checked locking.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it does not work, and multiple <code>Fitzer()</code> objects can be allocated. See The "Double-Checked Locking is Broken" Declaration for more details [1].
