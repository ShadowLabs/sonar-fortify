<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  <p>The function <code>xp_cmdshell</code> cannot be used safely.  It should not be used.</p>
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Certain functions behave in dangerous ways regardless of how they are used. The function <code>xp_cmdshell</code> launches a Windows command shell to execute the provided command string. The command executes either in the default system or a provided proxy context. However, there is no way to limit a user to prespecified set of privileged operations and any privilege grant opens up the user to execute any command string.
