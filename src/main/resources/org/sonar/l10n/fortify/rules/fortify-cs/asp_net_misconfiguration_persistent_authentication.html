<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Persistent authentication tickets leave users vulnerable to session hijacking.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The <code>FormsAuthentication.RedirectFromLoginPage()</code> method issues an authentication ticket, which allows users to remain authenticated for a specified period of time. When the method is invoked with the second argument <code>false</code>, it issues a temporary authentication ticket that remains valid for a period of time configured in <code>web.config</code>. When invoked with the second argument <code>true</code>, the method issues a persistent authentication ticket. On .NET 2.0, the lifetime of the persistent ticket respects the value in <code>web.config</code>, but on .NET 1.1, the persistent authentication ticket has a ridiculously long default lifetime -- fifty years. <br /><br />Allowing persistent authentication tickets to survive for a long period of time leaves users and the system vulnerable in the following ways: <br /><br />It expands the period of exposure to session hijacking attacks for users who fail to log out. <br /><br />It increases the average number of valid session identifiers available for an attacker to guess.<br /><br />It lengthens the duration of exploit when an attacker succeeds in hijacking a user's session.
