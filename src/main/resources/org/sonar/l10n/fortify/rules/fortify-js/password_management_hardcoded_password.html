<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Hardcoded passwords may compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br /><p><br />In this case the password was used to access a resource at <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to an application and retrieve addressbook entries:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />obj = new XMLHttpRequest();<br />obj.open('GET','/fetchusers.jsp?id='+form.id.value,'true','scott','tiger');<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who accesses the containing web page will be able to view the password.
