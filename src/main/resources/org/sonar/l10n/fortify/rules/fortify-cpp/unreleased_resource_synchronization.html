<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program fails to release a lock it holds, which might lead to deadlock.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource. <br /><p><br />In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not always released.<br /></p><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following function does destroy the condition variable it allocates if an error occurs. If the process is long-lived, the process can run out of file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />int helper(char* fName)<br />{<br />   int status; <br />   ...<br />   pthread_cond_init (&amp;count_threshold_cv, NULL);    <br />   pthread_mutex_init(&amp;count_mutex, NULL);<br /><br />   status = perform_operation();<br />   if (status) {<br />      printf("%s", "cannot perform operation");<br />      return OPERATION_FAIL;<br />   } <br />   <br />   pthread_mutex_destroy(&amp;count_mutex);<br />   pthread_cond_destroy(&amp;count_threshold_cv);<br />   <br />   return OPERATION_SUCCESS;<br />}<br /></pre>
