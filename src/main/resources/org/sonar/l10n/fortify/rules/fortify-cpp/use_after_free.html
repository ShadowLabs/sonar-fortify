<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Use after free errors occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. Like double free errors and memory leaks, use after free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory<br /><p><br />In this case the data is freed in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> and used again in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br />Use after free errors sometimes have no effect and other times cause a program to crash. While it is technically feasible for the freed memory to be re-allocated and for an attacker to use this reallocation to launch a buffer overflow attack, we are unaware of any exploits based on this type of attack.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code illustrates a use after free error:<br /><br /><pre><br />char* ptr = (char*)malloc (SIZE);<br />...<br />if (err) {<br />    abrt = 1;<br />    free(ptr);<br />}<br />...<br />if (abrt) {<br />    logError("operation aborted before commit", ptr);<br />}<br /></pre>
