<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.

<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br /><p><br />In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not always released.<br /></p><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following function does not close the file handle it opens. If the process is long-lived, it may run out of file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />BEGIN<br />...<br />  F1 := UTL_FILE.FOPEN('user_dir','u12345.tmp','R',256);<br />  UTL_FILE.GET_LINE(F1,V1,32767);<br />...<br />END;<br /></pre>
