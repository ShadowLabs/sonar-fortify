<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An overly long session timeout gives attackers more time to potentially compromise user accounts.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The longer a session stays open, the larger the window of opportunity an attacker has to compromise user accounts. While a session remains active, an attacker might be able to brute force a user's password, crack a user's wireless encryption key, or commandeer a session from an open browser. Longer session timeouts can also prevent memory from being released and eventually result in a denial of service if a sufficiently large number of sessions are created.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> If the session timeout is zero or less than zero, the session never expires. The following example shows a session timeout set to -1, which will cause the session to remain active indefinitely.<br /><pre><br />&lt;session-config&gt;<br />    &lt;session-timeout&gt;-1&lt;/session-timeout&gt;<br />&lt;/session-config&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />The <code>&lt;session-timeout&gt;</code> tag defines the default session timeout interval for all sessions in the web application. If the <code>&lt;session-timeout&gt;</code> tag is missing, it is left to the container to set the default timeout.
