<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Executing an LDAP statement that contains a user-controlled value outside the filter string can allow an attacker to alter the statement's meaning or execute arbitrary LDAP commands.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  LDAP manipulation errors occur when:<br /><br />1.	Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br /><p><br />In this case the data enters at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br />2.	The data is used outside the filter string in a dynamic LDAP statement. <br /><p><br />In this case the data is used by <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code reads a <code>dn</code> string from a socket and uses it to perform an LDAP query. <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />rc = ldap_simple_bind_s( ld, NULL, NULL );<br />  if ( rc != LDAP_SUCCESS ) {<br />    ...<br />  }<br />...<br /><br />fgets(dn, sizeof(dn), socket);<br /><br />if ( ( rc = ldap_search_ext_s( ld, dn, LDAP_SCOPE_BASE,<br />                               filter, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, LDAP_NO_LIMIT,<br />                               LDAP_NO_LIMIT, &amp;result ) ) != LDAP_SUCCESS ) {<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />Because base DN originates from user input and the query is performed under an anonymous bind, an attacker could alter the results of the query by specifying an unexpected <code>dn</code> string. The problem is that the developer failed to leverage the appropriate access control mechanisms necessary to restrict subsequent queries to access only employee records the current user is permitted to read.
