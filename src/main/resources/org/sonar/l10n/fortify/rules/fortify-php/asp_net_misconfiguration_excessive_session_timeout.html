<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An overly long authentication timeout gives attackers more time to potentially compromise user accounts.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The longer a session stays open, the larger the window of opportunity an attacker has to compromise user accounts. While a session remains active, an attacker might be able to brute force a user's password, crack a user's wireless encryption key, or commandeer a session from an open browser. Longer authentication timeouts can also prevent memory from being released and eventually result in a denial of service if a sufficiently large number of sessions are created.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following example shows ASP.NET MVC configured with an hour authentication timeout. <br /><pre><br />...<br />&lt;configuration&gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />  &lt;authentication&gt;<br />    &lt;forms <br />      timeout="60" /&gt;<br />  &lt;/authentication&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />If the timeout attribute is not specified the authentication timeout defaults to 30 minutes.
