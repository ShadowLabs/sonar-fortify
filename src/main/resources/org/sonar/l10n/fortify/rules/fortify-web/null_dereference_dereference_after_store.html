							<p>
							  The program can potentially dereference a null pointer, thereby causing a null pointer exception.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Null pointer exceptions usually occur when one or more of the programmer's assumptions is violated. A dereference-after-store error occurs when a program explicitly sets an object to null and dereferences it later. This error is often the result of a programmer initializing a variable to null when it is declared.<br><br><br>Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if attackers can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, they can use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.<br> <br><b>Example:</b> In the following code, the programmer explicitly sets the variable <code>foo</code> to <code>null</code>. Later, the programmer dereferences <code>foo</code> before checking the object for a null value.<br><br><pre><br>Foo foo = null;<br>...<br>foo.setBar(val);<br>...<br>}<br></pre>
