<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program defines an overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Prior to HTML5, Web browsers enforced the Same Origin Policy which ensures that in order for JavaScript to access the contents of a Web page, both the JavaScript and the Web page must originate from the same domain. Without the Same Origin Policy, a malicious website could serve up JavaScript that loads sensitive information from other websites using a client's credentials, culls through it, and communicates it back to the attacker. HTML5 makes it possible for JavaScript to access data across domains if a new HTTP header called <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> is defined. With this header, a Web server defines which other domains are allowed to access its domain using cross-origin requests. However, caution should be taken when defining the header because an overly permissive CORS policy will allow a malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way, leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> Below is an example of using a wildcard to programmatically specify which domains the application is allowed to communicate with.<br /><br /><pre><br />  &lt;?php<br />    header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');<br />  ?&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Using the <code>*</code> as the value of the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header indicates that the application's data is accessible to JavaScript running on any domain.
