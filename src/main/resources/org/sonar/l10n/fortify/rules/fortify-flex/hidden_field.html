<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A hidden form field is used.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Programmers often trust the contents of hidden fields, expecting that users will not be able to view them or manipulate their contents. Attackers will violate these assumptions. They will examine the values written to hidden fields and alter them or replace the contents with attack data.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> An <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag of type <code>hidden</code> indicates the use of a hidden field.<br /><pre><br />&lt;input type="hidden"&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />If hidden fields carry sensitive information, this information will be cached the same way the rest of the page is cached. This can lead to sensitive information being tucked away in the browser cache without the user's knowledge.
