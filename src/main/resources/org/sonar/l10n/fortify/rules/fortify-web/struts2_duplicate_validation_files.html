							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Multiple Struts2 Validation files exist for this Action. Multiple validation forms are an indication that validation is not up to date.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  More than one ActionClass-validation.xml file was discovered for this Struts2 Action definition. For each Struts2 Action defined in the form of ActionClass, Struts2 searches for a corresponding ActionClass-validation.xml for the necessary validation constraints. Having multiple validation definitions for one Action included in the deployment may result in unexpected behavior.<br><br>	    If two validation forms have the same name, the Struts Validator arbitrarily chooses one of the forms to use for input validation and discards the other. This decision might not correspond to the programmer's expectations. Moreover, it indicates that the validation logic is not being maintained, and can indicate that other, more subtle, validation errors are present.<br><br>It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the rest of the application. Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack. <br><br>
