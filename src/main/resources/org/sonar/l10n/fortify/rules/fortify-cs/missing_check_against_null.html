<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program might dereference a null pointer because it does not check the return value of a function that might return null.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br /><br />Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this function call fails". When a programmer ignores the return value from a function, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.<br /><p><br />In this case, an earlier return value is used without being checked in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example 1:</b>  The following code does not check to see if the string returned by the <code>Item</code> property is null before calling the member function <code>Equals()</code>, potentially causing a null dereference. <br /><br /><pre><br />string itemName = request.Item(ITEM_NAME);<br />	if (itemName.Equals(IMPORTANT_ITEM)) {<br />		...<br />	}<br />	...<br /></pre><br /><br />The traditional defense of this coding error is: <br /><br />"I know the requested value will always exist because.... If it does not exist, the program cannot perform the desired behavior so it doesn't matter whether I handle the error or simply allow the program to die dereferencing a null value." <br /><br />But attackers are skilled at finding unexpected paths through programs, particularly when exceptions are involved.
