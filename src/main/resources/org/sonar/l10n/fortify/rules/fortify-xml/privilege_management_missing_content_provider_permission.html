<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program attempts to perform an operation without requesting the required permission.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Certain Android operations require permissions.  Permissions have to be requested by the application at install time by listing them in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file via <code>&lt;uses-permission/&gt;</code> tags. If the required permissions are not requested, the operations that require these permissions will fail at runtime. In some cases, a <code>java.lang.SecurityException</code> is thrown back to the application. Other times, operations fail silently without an exception.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code reads contacts information stored on the device.<br /><br /><pre>Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI, null, null, null, null);</pre><br /><br />Reading data from this content provider requires the <code>android.permission.READ_CONTACTS</code> permission. If this permission is not requested by the application in the manifest file, the application will fail to read contacts information.
