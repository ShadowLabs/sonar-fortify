							<p>
							  A cookie with an overly broad domain opens an application to attacks through other applications.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Developers often set cookies to be active across a base domain like "<code>.example.com</code>". This exposes the cookie to all web applications on the base domain and any sub-domains. Since cookies often carry sensitive information such as session identifiers, sharing cookies across applications can lead a vulnerability in one application to cause a compromise in another.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b><br>Imagine you have a secure application deployed at <code>http://secure.example.com/</code> and the application sets a session ID cookie with domain "<code>.example.com</code>" when a user logs in.<br><br>For example:<br><pre><br>  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("sessionID", sessionID);<br>  cookie.setDomain(".example.com");<br></pre><br><br>Suppose you have another, less secure, application at <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code>, and it contains a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Any user authenticated to <code>http://secure.example.com</code> that browses to <code>http://insecure.example.com</code> risks exposing their session cookie from <code>http://secure.example.com</code>.<br><br>In addition to reading a cookie, it might be possible for attackers to perform a Cookie Poisoning attack by using <code>insecure.example.com</code> to create its own overly broad cookie that overwrites the cookie from <code>secure.example.com</code>.<br>
