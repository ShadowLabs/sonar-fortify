<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Revealing detailed system information helps an adversary learn about the system and form a plan of attack.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  If the <code>expose_php</code> option is enabled, every response produced by the PHP interpreter includes the version of PHP installed on the host system. Armed with the version of PHP running on the remote server, an attacker can enumerate the known exploits against the system, which can greatly lower the cost of mounting a successful attack.
