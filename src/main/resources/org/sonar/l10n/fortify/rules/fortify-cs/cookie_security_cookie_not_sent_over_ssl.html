<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A cookie is created without the <code>secure</code> flag set to <code>true</code>.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Modern web browsers support a <code>secure</code> flag for each cookie.  If the flag is set, the browser will only send the cookie over HTTPS. Sending cookies over an unencrypted channel can expose them to network sniffing attacks, so the secure flag helps keep a cookie's value confidential. This is especially important if the cookie contains private data or carries a session identifier.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case a cookie created in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/>, but <code>setSecure()</code> is not called or is called with the value <code>false</code>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> In the example below, a cookie added to the response without setting the <code>Secure</code> property.<br /><pre><br />...<br /> HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("emailCookie", email);<br />    Response.AppendCookie(cookie);<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />If your application uses both HTTPS and HTTP but does not set the <code>secure</code> flag, cookies set during an HTTPS request will also be sent during subsequent HTTP requests. Sniffing network traffic over unencrypted wireless connections is a trivial task for attackers, so sending cookies (especially those with session IDs) over HTTP can result in application compromise.
