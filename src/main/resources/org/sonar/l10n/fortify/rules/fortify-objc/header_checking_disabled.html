<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The application sets a property that causes validation errors that occur during HTTP parsing to be ignored.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Setting <code>useUnsafeHeaderParsing</code> to <code>true</code> relaxes processing of HTTP headers. Overly permissive validation rules on HTTP headers can permit a variety of attacks against vulnerable applications. <br />      <br /><p><br />In this case useUnsafeHeaderParsing is set to <code>true</code> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br />Specifically, when this property is set to false, the following validation rules are no longer enforced:<br /><br />    In end-of-line code, use CRLF; using CR or LF alone is not allowed.<br /><br />    Headers names should not have spaces in them.<br /><br />    If multiple status lines exist, all additional status lines are treated as malformed header name/value pairs.<br /><br />    The status line must have a status description, in addition to a status code.<br /><br />    Header names cannot have non-ASCII characters in them. This validation is performed whether this property is set to true or false.<br /><br />When a protocol violation occurs, a WebException exception is thrown with the status set to ServerProtocolViolation. If the UseUnsafeHeaderParsing property is set to true, validation errors are ignored.<br /><br />Setting this property to true has security implications, so it should only be done if backward compatibility with a server is required.<br />    <br /> <br /><p><br />In this case useUnsafeHeaderParsing is set to true in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> In the example below, <code>useUnsafeHeaderParsing</code> is set to true.<br /><pre><br />...<br />&lt;configuration&gt;<br />   &lt;system.net&gt;<br />   &lt;settings&gt;<br />      &lt;httpWebRequest  useUnsafeHeaderParsing="true" /&gt; <br />   &lt;/settings&gt;<br />   &lt;/system.net&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />...<br /></pre>
