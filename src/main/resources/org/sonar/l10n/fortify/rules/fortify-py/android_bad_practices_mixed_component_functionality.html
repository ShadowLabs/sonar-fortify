<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This receiver component is registered to receive messages from the system and also other components.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  System broadcasts can be sent to private components.  Components need to be public to receive non-system broadcasts from third-parties.  By registering to receive both system and non-system broadcasts in a single component, some of the functionality of the component (the system portion) is unnecessarily exposed to third parties.
