							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program fails to release a lock it holds, which might lead to deadlock.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br><br>Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br><br>Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code establishes a lock before <code>performOperationInCriticalSection()</code>, but fails to release the lock if an exception is thrown in that method.<br><br><pre><br>ReentrantLock  myLock = new ReentrantLock ();<br><br>myLock.lock();<br>performOperationInCriticalSection();<br>myLock.unlock();<br></pre><br>
