<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This method is not reachable from any method outside the class.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  This method is never called or is only called from other dead code. Dead code is defined as code that is never directly or indirectly executed by a public method.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> In the following class, the method <code>DoWork()</code> can never be called.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class Dead {<br />  private void DoWork() {<br />    Console.Write("doing work");<br />  }<br />  public static void Main(string[] args) {<br />    Console.Write("running Dead");<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> In the following class, two private methods call each other, but since neither one is ever invoked from anywhere else, they are both dead code.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class DoubleDead {<br />  private void DoTweedledee() {<br />    DoTweedledumb();<br />  }<br />  private void DoTweedledumb() {<br />    DoTweedledee();<br />  }<br />  public static void Main(string[] args) {<br />    Console.Write("running DoubleDead");<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />(In this case it is a good thing that the methods are dead: invoking either one would cause an infinite loop.)
