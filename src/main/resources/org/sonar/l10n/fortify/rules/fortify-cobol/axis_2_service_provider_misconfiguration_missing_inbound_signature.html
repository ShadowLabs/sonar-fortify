<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  If a message is not signed, the integrity the message cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Any part of a message that is not signed has the potential to be intercepted and modified without being detected by the receiver. Without a signature, a receiver cannot cryptographically verify that the contents of a message are authentic.<br /><br />The following service provider configuration tells Axis 2 to accept unsigned messages:<br /><pre><br />&lt;service&gt;<br />...<br />	&lt;parameter name=&quot;InflowSecurity&quot;&gt;<br />		&lt;action&gt;<br />			&lt;items&gt;Timestamp Encrypt&lt;/items&gt;<br />			...<br />		&lt;/action&gt;<br />	&lt;/parameter&gt;<br />&lt;/service&gt;<br /></pre>
