<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A missing signature means the integrity of a SOAP message cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Any part of a message that is not signed has the potential to be intercepted and modified without the knowledge of the sender or the receiver. Without a signature, the receiver cannot cryptographically verify that the contents of a message really originated with the sender.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> does not contain a <code>&lt;requiredIntegrity&gt;</code> tag.<br /></p>
