<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A web application should not attempt to shut down its container.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea for a web application to attempt to shut down the application container. A call to <code>System.exit()</code> is probably part of leftover debug code or code imported from a non-J2EE application.
