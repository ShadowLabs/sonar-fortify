<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Allowing user input to control resource identifiers could enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A resource injection issue occurs when the following two conditions are met:<br /><br />3.	An attacker can specify the identifier used to access a system resource. <br /><br />For example, an attacker might be able to specify a port number to be used to connect to a network resource. <br /><br />4.	By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.<br /><br />For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to transmit sensitive information to a third-party server. <br /><p><br />In this case, the attacker can specify the value that enters the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>, and this value is used to access a system resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br />Note: Resource injection that involves resources stored on the filesystem goes by the name path manipulation and is reported in separate category. See the path manipulation description for further details of this vulnerability. <br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a CGI environment variable as a URL of a document to be downloaded.  <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />filename := SUBSTR(OWA_UTIL.get_cgi_env('PATH_INFO'), 2);<br />WPG_DOCLOAD.download_file(filename); <br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />The kind of resource affected by user input indicates the kind of content that may be dangerous.  For example, data containing special characters like period, slash, and backslash are risky when used in functions that interact with the file system. Similarly, data that contains URLs and URIs is risky for functions that create remote connections.
