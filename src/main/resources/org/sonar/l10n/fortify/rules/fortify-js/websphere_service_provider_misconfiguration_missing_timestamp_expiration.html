<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A SOAP message with a timestamp that does not expire is vulnerable to replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  When a timestamp expires, any security semantics sent with the timestamp should expire as well. Therefore, timestamps without an expiration could allow security semantics (such as UsernameToken credentials) to remain valid indefinitely.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, the service provider configuration contains an <code>&lt;addTimestamp&gt;</code> element with no expires attribute at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/>.<br /></p>
