<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Servlet member fields might allow one user to see another user's data.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Many Servlet developers do not understand that a Servlet is a singleton. There is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads. <br /><br />A common result of this misunderstanding is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following Servlet stores the value of a request parameter in a member field and then later echoes the parameter value to the response output stream.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class GuestBook extends HttpServlet {<br /><br />   String name;<br /><br />   protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req,<br />                       HttpServletResponse res) {<br />     name = req.getParameter("name");<br />     ...<br />     out.println(name + ", thanks for visiting!");<br />   }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />While this code will work perfectly in a single-user environment, if two users access the Servlet at approximately the same time, it is possible for the two request handler threads to interleave in the following way:<br /><br />	Thread 1:	assign "<code>Dick</code>" to <code>name</code><br />	Thread 2:	assign "<code>Jane</code>" to <code>name</code><br />	Thread 1:	print "<code>Jane, thanks for visiting!</code>"<br />	Thread 2:	print "<code>Jane, thanks for visiting!</code>"<br /><br /> Thereby showing the first user the second user's name.
