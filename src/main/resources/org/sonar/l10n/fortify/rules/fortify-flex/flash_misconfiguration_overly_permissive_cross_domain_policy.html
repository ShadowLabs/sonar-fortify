<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program defines an overly permissive cross-domain policy.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  By default, Flash applications are subject to the Same Origin Policy which ensures that two SWF applications can access each other's data only if they come from the same domain. Adobe Flash allows developers to alter the policy either programmatically or via appropriate settings in the <code>crossdomain.xml</code> configuration file. However, caution should be taken when changing the settings because an overly permissive cross-domain policy will allow a malicious application to communicate with the victim application in an inappropriate way, leading to spoofing, data theft, relay and other attacks.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> Below is an example of using a wildcard to programmatically specify which domains the application is allowed to communicate with.<br /><br /><pre><br />   flash.system.Security.allowDomain("*");<br /></pre><br /><br />Using the <code>*</code> as the argument to <code>allowDomain()</code> indicates that the application's data is accessible to other SWF applications from any domain.
