<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Debugging messages help attackers learn about the system and plan a form of attack.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  ASP .NET applications can be configured to produce debug binaries. These binaries give detailed debugging messages and should not be used in production environments. The <code>debug</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;compilation&gt;</code> tag defines whether compiled binaries should include debugging information.<br /><p><br />In this case the <code>debug</code> attribute is set to <code>true</code> on the <code>&lt;compilation&gt;</code> tag defined in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br />The use of debug binaries causes an application to provide as much information about itself as possible to the user. Debug binaries are meant to be used in a development or testing environment and can pose a security risk if they are deployed to production. Attackers can leverage the additional information they gain from debugging output to mount attacks targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.
