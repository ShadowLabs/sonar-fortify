<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Storing a password in plaintext or using weak encryption could result in a system compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  ASP.NET applications can store user name and password pairs in <code>&lt;credentials&gt;</code> elements in the <code>web.config</code> file for an ASP.NET application, which supports plaintext, MD5 and SHA1 password formats. <br /><br />Passwords stored in plaintext or using a weak encryption algorithm are accessible to anyone with the access to the application's configuration files. This may include the machine where the application is hosted or the source code repository where the application lives. <br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following <code>web.config</code>  entry incorrectly stores its passwords in plaintext.<br /><br /><pre><br />&lt;configuration&gt;<br />  &lt;system.web&gt;<br />    &lt;authentication&gt;<br />      &lt;forms protection="All"&gt;<br />	   &lt;credentials passwordFormat="Clear"&gt;<br />   		&lt;user name="user1" password="my_password"/&gt;<br />		&lt;user name="user2" password="my_password1"/&gt;<br />        &lt;/credentials&gt;	<br />    	 &lt;/forms&gt;<br />    &lt;/authentication&gt;<br />  &lt;/system.web&gt;<br />&lt;/configuration&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />ASP.NET supports credential passwords stored in three formats, specified by the <code>passwordFormat</code> attribute of the <code>configuration/system.web/authentication/forms/credentials</code> element. The possible values for this attribute are:<br /><br /><code>Clear</code> - indicates that the password is stored in plaintext (least secure)<br /><code>MD5</code> - indicates that the password's MD5 hash is stored <br /><code>SHA1</code> - indicates that the password's SHA1 hash is stored (most secure)<br /><br />While an MD5 hash is more secure than plaintext, researchers have found brute-force attacks against the MD5 hashing algorithm. At this time, a SHA1 hash still provides reasonable protection against such attacks.
