<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This variable is never used.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  This variable is never used. It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused variable points out a bug.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> In the following code, a copy-and-paste error has lead to the same loop iterator (<code>i</code>) being used twice. The variable <code>j</code> is never used.<br /><br /><pre><br />  int i,j;<br /><br />  for (i=0; i &lt; outer; i++) {<br />    for (i=0; i &lt; inner; i++) {<br />      ...<br /></pre>
