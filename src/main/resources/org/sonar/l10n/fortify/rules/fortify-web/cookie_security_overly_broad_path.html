							<p>
							  A cookie with an overly broad path can be accessed through other applications on the same domain.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Developers often set cookies to be accessible from the root context path ("<code>/</code>"). Doing so exposes the cookie to all web applications on the domain. Since cookies often carry sensitive information such as session identifiers, sharing cookies across applications can lead a vulnerability in one application to cause a compromise in another.<br><br>  <b>Example 1:</b><br>Imagine you have a forum application deployed at <code>http://communitypages.example.com/MyForum</code> and the application sets a session ID cookie with path "<code>/</code>" when users log in to the forum.<br><br>For example:<br><pre><br>  Cookie cookie = new Cookie("sessionID", sessionID);<br>  cookie.setPath("/");<br></pre><br><br>Suppose an attacker creates another application at <code>http://communitypages.example.com/EvilSite</code> and posts a link to this site on the forum. When a user of the forum clicks on the link, his browser will send the cookie set by <code>/MyForum</code> to the application running at <code>/EvilSite</code>. By stealing the session ID, the attacker is able to compromise the account of any forum user that browsed to <code>/EvilSite</code>.<br><br>In addition to reading a cookie, it might be possible for attackers to perform a Cookie Poisoning attack by using <code>/EvilSite</code> to create its own overly broad cookie that overwrites the cookie from <code>/MyForum</code>.<br>
