<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Privileged code in <code>public</code> methods can be called from anywhere in the JVM.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Secure coding principles advocate making access specifiers as restrictive as possible. A method with a <code>public</code> access specifier means that any external code is allowed to call it. Public methods that perform privileged actions can be dangerous when code is shared in libraries or in environments where code can dynamically enter the system (e.g. Code Injection, Dangerous File Inclusion, File Upload, etc).<br /><br /><p>In this case, the method at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> performs a privilege operation and has a <code>public</code> access specifier.</p><br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> In the following code, <code>doPrivilegedOpenFile()</code> is declared <code>public</code> and performs a privileged operation.<br /><pre><br />public static void doPrivilegedOpenFile(final String filePath) {<br />final BadFileNamePrivilegedAction pa = new BadFileNamePrivilegedAction(filePath);<br /><br />FileInputStream fis = null;<br />...<br />fis = (FileInputStream)AccessController.doPrivileged(pa);<br />...<br />}<br /></pre>
