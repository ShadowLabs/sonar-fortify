<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Storing a non-serializable object as an <code>HttpSessionState</code> attribute can damage application reliability.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  By default, ASP.NET servers store the <code>HttpSessionState</code> object, its attributes and any objects they reference in memory. This model limits active session state to what can be accommodated by the system memory of a single machine. In order to expand capacity beyond these limitations, servers are frequently configured to persistent session state information, which both expands capacity and permits the replication across multiple machines to improve overall performance. In order to persist its session state, the server must serialize the <code>HttpSessionState</code> object, which requires that all objects stored in it be serializable.<br /><br />In order for the session to be serialized correctly, all objects the application stores as session attributes must declare the <code>[Serializable]</code> attribute. Additionally, if the object requires custom serialization methods, it must also implement the <code>ISerializable</code> interface.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following class adds itself to the session, but since it is not serializable, the session cannot be serialized correctly.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class DataGlob {<br />   String GlobName;<br />   String GlobValue;<br /><br />   public void AddToSession(HttpSessionState session) {<br />     session["glob"] = this;<br />   }<br />}<br /></pre>
