<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Allowing PHP scripts to access arbitrary files on the server can permit attackers to manipulate sensitive files or execute malicious commands.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The <code>safe_mode</code> option is one of the most important security features in PHP. When <code>safe_mode</code> is disabled, PHP operates on files with the permissions of the user that invoked it, which is often a privileged user. Although configuring PHP with <code>safe_mode</code> disabled does not introduce a security vulnerability itself, this added leniency can be exploited by attackers in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to make exploits more dangerous.
