<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An unsigned timestamp can leave a SOAP message open to tampering and replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Security timestamp indicates a message's freshness. If an attacker intercepts a message retransmits it at a later time, the receiver can reject the replay attack because the timestamp will indicate that the message is stale. Optionally, timestamps can include an expiration attribute which places a hard limit on how long security semantics are valid.<br /><br />To prevent attackers from tampering with timestamps, timestamps should be signed. Without a signed timestamp, an attacker can intercept a SOAP message, modify the timestamp, and send the message on without the receiver's knowledge. Under these circumstances, an attacker can potentially trick a recipient into accepting a malicious message.<br /><br />The following service provider configuration tells Axis 2 to accept messages with unsigned timestamps:        <br /><pre><br />&lt;service&gt;<br />...<br />	&lt;parameter name=&quot;InflowSecurity&quot;&gt;<br />		&lt;action&gt;<br />			&lt;items&gt;Timestamp Encrypt&lt;/items&gt;<br />			...<br />		&lt;/action&gt;<br />	&lt;/parameter&gt;<br />&lt;/service&gt;<br /></pre>
