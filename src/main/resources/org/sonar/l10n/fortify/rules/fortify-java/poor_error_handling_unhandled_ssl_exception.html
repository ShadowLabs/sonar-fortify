<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Failing to explicitly handle SSL exceptions can cause the application to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Unhandled SSL exception vulnerabilities occur when:<br /><br />1.	An SSL-specific exception is thrown.<br /><p><br />In this case the exception is thrown by <Replace key="$fc.name$" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br />2.	The exception is not explicitly handled. <br /><br />The SSL-specific exceptions <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException</code>, <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLKeyException</code>, and <code>javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException</code> all convey important errors related to an SSL connection. If these errors are not explicitly handled, the connection can be left in an unexpected and potential insecure state. <br /><br />Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br /><br />Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this operation can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this operation fails". When a programmer fails to catch an exception that an operation may throw, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.
