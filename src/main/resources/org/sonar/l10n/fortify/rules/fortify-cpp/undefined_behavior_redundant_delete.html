<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Explicitly deleting a managed pointer will cause the program to crash or otherwise misbehave.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Deleting a managed pointer will cause the program to crash or otherwise do the wrong thing when, later on, the pointer management code assumes that the pointer is still valid. The following example illustrates the error.<br /><br /><pre><br />  std::auto_ptr&lt;foo&gt; p(new foo);<br />  foo* rawFoo = p.get();<br />  delete rawFoo;<br /></pre><br /><br />The only exception to this rule comes when a managed pointer class supports a "detach" operation allowing the programmer to take control of memory management for the given pointer.  If the program detaches the pointer from the management class before calling <code>delete</code>, the management class knows not to use the pointer any further.
