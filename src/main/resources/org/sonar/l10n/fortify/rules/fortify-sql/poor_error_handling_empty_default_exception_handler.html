<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Ignoring an exception can cause the program to overlook unexpected states and conditions.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Just about every serious attack on a software system begins with the violation of a programmer's assumptions. After the attack, the programmer's assumptions seem flimsy and poorly founded, but before an attack many programmers would defend their assumptions well past the end of their lunch break.<br /><br />Two dubious assumptions that are easy to spot in code are "this function call can never fail" and "it doesn't matter if this call fails". When a programmer ignores an exception, they implicitly state that they are operating under one of these assumptions.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code ignores several exceptions that could be thrown while executing the insert statement.<br /><br /><pre><br />PROCEDURE do_it_all<br />IS<br />BEGIN<br />  BEGIN<br />    INSERT INTO table1 VALUES(...);<br />    COMMIT;<br />  EXCEPTION<br />    WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL;<br />  END;<br />END do_it_all;<br /></pre><br /><br />An exception could be thrown because the table does not exist, a required value is not provided, or some other reason. If a failure occurs, there is no way to tell because the procedure will not report the failure or record what type of failure has occurred.
