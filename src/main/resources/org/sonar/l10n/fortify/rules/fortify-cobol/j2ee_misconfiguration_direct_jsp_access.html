<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Direct access to Java Server Pages can lead to system information leak, source code disclosure and even arbitrary code execution.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Directly accessing Java Server Pages (JSPs) in applications built using web frameworks, such as Struts or Spring, that use actions or servlets to delegate requests to JSPs can result in unhandled exceptions and system information leaks. Poorly implemented or configured application servers have been co-opted into leaking source code details using specially crafted requests, such as <code>http://host/page.jsp%00</code> or <code>http://host/page.js%2570</code>. Even worse, if an application permits users to upload arbitrary files, attackers can use this mechanism to upload malicious code in the form of a JSP and request the uploaded page to cause the malicious code to execute on the server.<br /><br /><p>In this case, the security constraint at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> permits users to access JSPs.</p><br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following example shows a poorly constructed security constraint that explicitly allows direct access to JSPs with a '*' in the role name, which indicates that all users are allowed access the corresponding web resources.<br /><pre><br />&lt;security-constraint&gt;<br />    &lt;web-resource-collection&gt;<br />        &lt;web-resource-name&gt;JSP Access for Everyone!&lt;/web-resource-name&gt;<br />        &lt;description&gt;Allow any user/role access to JSP&lt;/description&gt;<br />        &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;<br />    &lt;/web-resource-collection&gt;<br />    &lt;auth-constraint&gt;<br />        &lt;role-name&gt;*&lt;/role-name&gt;<br />    &lt;/auth-constraint&gt;<br />&lt;/security-constraint&gt;<br /></pre>
