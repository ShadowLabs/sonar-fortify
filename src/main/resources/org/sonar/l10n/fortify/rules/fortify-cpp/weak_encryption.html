<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program uses a weak encryption algorithm that cannot guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive data.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Antiquated encryption algorithms such as DES no longer provide sufficient protection for use with sensitive data. Encryption algorithms rely on key size as one of the primary mechanism to ensure cryptographic strength. Cryptographic strength is often measured by the time and computational power needed to generate a valid key. Advances in computing power have made it possible to obtain small encryption keys in a reasonable amount of time. For example, the 56-bit key used in DES posed a significant computational hurdle in the 1970's when the algorithm was first developed, but today DES can be cracked in less than a day using commonly available equipment.
