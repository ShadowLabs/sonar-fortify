<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An otherwise strong encryption algorithm is vulnerable to brute force attack when a small key size is used.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Current cryptography guidelines suggest that key lengths of at least 1024 bits should be used with the RSA algorithm. However, increased computing power and advances in factoring techniques[1] are challenging the security of 1024 bit RSA encryption.<br /><br />When it comes to symmetric encryption, the key lengths should be at least 128 bits.
