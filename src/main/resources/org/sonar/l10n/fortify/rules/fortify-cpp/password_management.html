<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Storing a password in plaintext could result in a system compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's configuration files or other data store.<br /><p><br />In this case, the password is read into the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/> and used to access a resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code reads a password from the registry and uses the password to connect to a database.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />RegQueryValueEx(hkey,TEXT(.SQLPWD.),NULL,<br />                NULL,(LPBYTE)pwd, &amp;size);<br />rc = SQLConnect(*hdbc, server, SQL_NTS, uid, <br />                SQL_NTS, pwd, SQL_NTS);<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to the registry key used to store the password can read the value of <code>pwd</code>. If a devious employee has access to this information, they can use it to break into the system.
