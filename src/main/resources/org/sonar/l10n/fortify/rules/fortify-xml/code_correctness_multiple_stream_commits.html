<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  After a servlet's output stream has already been committed, it is erroneous to reset the stream buffer or perform any other action that recommits to the stream. Likewise, it is erroneous to call <code>getWriter()</code> after calling <code>getOutputStream</code> or vice versa.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Forwarding an <code>HttpServletRequest</code>, redirecting an <code>HttpServletResponse</code>, or flushing the servlet's output stream buffer causes the associated stream to commit. Any subsequent buffer resets or stream commits, such as additional flushes or redirects, will result in <code>IllegalStateException</code>s.<br /><br />Furthermore, Java servlets allow data to be written to the response stream using either <code>ServletOutputStream</code> or <code>PrintWriter</code>, but not both. Calling <code>getWriter()</code> after having called <code>getOutputStream()</code>, or vice versa, will also cause an <code>IllegalStateException</code>.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, the stream had previously been committed or obtained by <Replace key="FirstTransitionFunction"/> on line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> of <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/>.<br /></p><br /><br />At runtime, an <code>IllegalStateException</code> prevents the response handler from running to completion, effectively dropping the response. This can cause server instability, which is a sign of an improperly implemented servlet.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code redirects the servlet response after its output stream buffer has been flushed.<br /><pre><br />public class RedirectServlet extends HttpServlet {<br />    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {<br />        ...<br />        OutputStream out = res.getOutputStream();<br />        ...<br />        // flushes, and thereby commits, the output stream<br />        out.flush();<br />        out.close();        // redirecting the response causes an IllegalStateException<br />        res.sendRedirect("http://www.acme.com");<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> Conversely, the following code attempts to write to and flush the <code>PrintWriter</code>'s buffer after the request has been forwarded.<br /><pre><br />public class FlushServlet extends HttpServlet {<br />    public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {<br />        ...<br />        // forwards the request, implicitly committing the stream<br />        getServletConfig().getServletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/jsp/boom.jsp").forward(req, res);<br />        ...<br /><br />        // IllegalStateException; cannot redirect after forwarding<br />        res.sendRedirect("http://www.acme.com/jsp/boomboom.jsp");<br /><br />        PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();<br /><br />        // writing to an already-committed stream will not cause an exception,<br />        // but will not apply these changes to the final output, either<br />        out.print("Writing here does nothing");<br /><br />        // IllegalStateException; cannot flush a response's buffer after forwarding the request<br />        out.flush();<br />        out.close();<br />    }<br />}<br /></pre>
