<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  If a parent process finishes execution normally before the threads it has spawned, the threads can be terminated prematurely.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Threads spawned by calling <code>pthread_create()</code> from the <code>main()</code> function of the parent process will be terminated prematurely if the parent process finishes execution before any the threads it has spawned without calling <code>pthread_exit()</code>. Calling <code>pthread_exit()</code> guarantees that the parent process will be kept alive until all of its threads have finished execution. Alternatively, the parent process can call <code>pthread_join</code> on all of the child threads and ensure they will complete before the process concludes.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses <code>pthread_create()</code> to create a thread and then exits normally. If the child thread has not completed its execution by the time the <code>main()</code> function returns, then it will be terminated prematurely. <br /><br /><pre><br />void *Simple(void *threadid)<br />{<br />   ...<br />   pthread_exit(NULL);<br />}<br /><br />int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {<br />   int rc;<br />   pthread_t pt; <br />   rc = pthread_create(&amp;pt, NULL, Simple, (void *)t);<br />   if (rc){<br />     exit(-1);<br />   }<br />}<br /></pre>
