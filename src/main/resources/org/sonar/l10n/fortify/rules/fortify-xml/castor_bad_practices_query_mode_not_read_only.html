<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A Castor query that is not read-only can have performance implications.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Even if castor creates a lock on an object it does not prevent other threads from reading or writing to it. Read-only queries are also about 7 times faster compared with default shared mode.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following example specifies the query mode as <code>SHARED</code> which allows both read and write access.<br /><pre><br />results = query.execute(Database.SHARED);<br /></pre>
