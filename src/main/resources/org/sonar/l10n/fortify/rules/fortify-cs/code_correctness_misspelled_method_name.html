<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This looks like an effort to override a common .NET method, but it probably does not have the intended effect.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  This method's name is similar to a common .NET method name, but it is either spelled incorrectly or the argument list causes it to not override the intended method.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following method is meant to override <code>System.Object.Equals()</code>:<br /><br /><pre><br />public boolean Equals(string obj) {<br />  ...<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />But since <code>System.Object.Equals()</code> takes an argument of type <code>object</code>, the method above is never called.
