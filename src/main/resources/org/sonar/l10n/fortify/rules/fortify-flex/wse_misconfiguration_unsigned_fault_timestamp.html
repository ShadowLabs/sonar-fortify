<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An unsigned timestamp can leave a SOAP message open to tampering and replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Security timestamp indicates a message's freshness. If an attacker intercepts a message retransmits it at a later time, the receiver can reject the replay attack because the timestamp will indicate that the message is stale. Optionally, timestamps can include an expiration attribute which places a hard limit on how long security semantics are valid.<br /><br />To prevent attackers from tampering with timestamps, timestamps should be signed. Without a signed timestamp, an attacker can intercept a SOAP message, modify the timestamp, and send the message on without the receiver's knowledge. Under these circumstances, an attacker can potentially trick a recipient into accepting a malicious message.<br /><br />The following snippet from a WSE policy file is an example where timestamps are not include in SOAP faults:<br /><pre><br />&lt;policies xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/wse/2005/06/policy&quot;&gt;<br />...<br />      &lt;protection&gt;<br />        &lt;fault signatureOptions=&quot;IncludeAddressing, IncludeSoapBody&quot; encryptBody=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;<br /></pre>
