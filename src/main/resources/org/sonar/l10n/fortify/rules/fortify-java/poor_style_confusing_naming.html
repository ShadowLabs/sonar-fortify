<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The class contains a field and a method with the same name.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is confusing to have a member field and a method with the same name. It makes it easy for a programmer to accidentally call the method when attempting to access the field or vice versa.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> <br /><br /><pre><br />public class Totaller {<br />  private int total;<br />  public int total() {<br />    ...<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre>
