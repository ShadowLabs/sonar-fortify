<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program uses an arithmetic operator on a boolean value, which might not achieve what the programmer had in mind. 
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Arithmetic operations will not act in the same way on boolean values as they would on integral values, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
