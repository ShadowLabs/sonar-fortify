  This field is never used directly or indirectly by a public method.

<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  This field is never accessed, except perhaps by dead code. Dead code is defined as code that is never directly or indirectly executed by a public method. It is likely that the field is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused field points out a bug.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The field named <code>glue</code> is not used in the following class. The author of the class has accidentally put quotes around the field name, transforming it into a string constant.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class Dead {<br /><br />  string glue;<br /><br />  public string GetGlue() {<br />    return "glue";<br />  }<br /><br />}<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> The field named <code>glue</code> is used in the following class, but only from a method that is never called by a public method.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class Dead {<br /><br />  string glue;<br /><br />  private string GetGlue() {<br />    return glue;<br />  }<br /><br />}<br /></pre>
