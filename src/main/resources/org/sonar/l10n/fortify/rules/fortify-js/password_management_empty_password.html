<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Empty passwords may compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to have an empty password. It also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult once the code is in production. The password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the empty password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br /><p><br />In this case the password was used to access a resource at <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code has an empty password to connect to an application and retrieve addressbook entries:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />obj = new XMLHttpRequest();<br />obj.open('GET','/fetchusers.jsp?id='+form.id.value,'true','scott','');<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone can access when they know the username.
