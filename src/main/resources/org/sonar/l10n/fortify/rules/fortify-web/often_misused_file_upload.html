							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  Permitting users to upload files can allow attackers to inject dangerous content or malicious code to run on the server.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Regardless of the language a program is written in, the most devastating attacks often involve remote code execution, whereby an attacker succeeds in executing malicious code in the program's context. If attackers are allowed to upload files to a directory that is accessible from the Web and cause these files to be passed to a code interpreter (e.g. JSP/ASPX/PHP), then they can cause malicious code contained in these files to execute on the server.<br><br><b>Example:</b> The following Struts 2 action class implements a setter than can be used to handle uploaded files.<br><pre><br>public class Struts2Upload extends ActionSupport<br>{<br>    ...<br>    private File uploadFile;<br>    public void setUploadFile(File file)<br>    {<br>        uploadFile = file;<br>    }<br>    ...<br>}<br></pre><br><br>Even if a program stores uploaded files under a directory that isn't accessible from the Web, attackers might still be able to leverage the ability to introduce malicious content into the server environment to mount other attacks. If the program is susceptible to path manipulation, command injection, or dangerous file inclusion vulnerabilities, then an attacker might upload a file with malicious content and cause the program to read or execute it by exploiting another vulnerability.
