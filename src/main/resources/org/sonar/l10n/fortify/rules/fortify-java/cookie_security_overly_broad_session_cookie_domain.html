<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A session cookie with an overly broad domain can be accessed by applications sharing the same base domain.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Developers often set session cookies to be a base domain like "<code>.example.com</code>". However, doing so exposes the session cookie to all web applications on the base domain name and any sub-domains. Leaking session cookies can lead to account compromises.<br /><br />  <b>Example:</b><br />  Imagine you have a secure application deployed at <code>http://secure.example.com/</code> and the application sets a session cookie with domain "<code>.example.com</code>" when users log in.<br /><br />The application's configuration file would have the following entry:<br /><pre><br />session.cookie_domain=.example.com<br /></pre><br /><br />  Suppose you have another less secure application at <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code> and it contains a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Any user authenticated to <code>http://secure.example.com</code> that browses to <code>http://insecure.example.com</code> risks exposing their session cookie from <code>http://secure.example.com</code>.
