<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Without proper authorization checks, the program may allow an unauthorized user to start a restricted transaction.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The ABAP program can start a new transaction by calling the <code>CALL TRANSACTION</code> command. If there is no authorization check performed before the call, the user running the ABAB program will be able to start a transaction that otherwise may be restricted to this user.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code calls a transaction that starts the ABAP editor.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />CALL TRANSACTION 'SE38' USING BDCDATA  MODE 'N'<br />                        MESSAGES INTO MESSTAB.<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />In this case, an otherwise unauthorized user running the code may be able to start the ABAP editor and inject arbitrary code into the SAP system.
