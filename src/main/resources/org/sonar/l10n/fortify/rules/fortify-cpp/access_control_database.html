<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Without proper access control, executing a SQL statement that contains a user-controlled primary key can allow an attacker to view unauthorized records.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Database access control errors occur when:<br /><br />1.	Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br /><p><br />In this case the data enters at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br /><br />2.	The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query. <br /><p><br />In this case the data is used by <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user.  <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />CMyRecordset rs(&amp;dbms);<br />rs.PrepareSQL("SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = ?");<br />rs.SetParam_int(0,atoi(r.Lookup("invoiceID").c_str()));<br />rs.SafeExecuteSQL();<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />The problem is that the developer has failed to consider all of the possible values of <code>id</code>. Although the interface generates a list of invoice identifiers that belong to the current user, an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if it does not belong to the current user.
