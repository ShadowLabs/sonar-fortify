							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The program can potentially fail to release a socket.<br><br><br>Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br><br>- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br><br>- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br><br>Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following method never closes the socket it opens. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its sockets.<br><br><pre><br>private void echoSocket(String host, int port) throws UnknownHostException, SocketException, IOException<br>{<br>  Socket sock = new Socket(host, port);<br>  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream()));<br><br>  while ((String socketData = reader.readLine()) != null) {<br>    System.out.println(socketData);<br>  }<br>}<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> Under normal conditions, the following fix properly closes the socket and any associated streams. But if an exception occurs while reading the input or writing the data to screen, the socket object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the system will run out of sockets and not be able to handle any further connections.<br><br><pre><br>private void echoSocket(String host, int port) throws UnknownHostException, SocketException, IOException<br>{<br>  Socket sock = new Socket(host, port);<br>  BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream()));<br><br>  while ((String socketData = reader.readLine()) != null) {<br>    System.out.println(socketData);<br>  }<br>  sock.close();<br>}<br></pre><br>
