<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Allowing external control of system settings can disrupt service or cause an application to behave in unexpected ways.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Setting manipulation vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can control values that govern the behavior of the system, manage specific resources, or in some way affect the functionality of the application.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, potentially malicious data enters the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/> and is passed to <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br />Because setting manipulation covers a diverse set of functions, any attempt at illustrating it will inevitably be incomplete. Rather than searching for a tight-knit relationship between the functions addressed in the setting manipulation category, take a step back and consider the sorts of system values that an attacker should not be allowed to control. <br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following COBOL code snippet reads values from the terminal and uses them to compute the options used to establish access to a queue object.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />ACCEPT OPT1.<br />ACCEPT OPT2<br />COMPUTE OPTS = OPT1 + OPT2.<br />CALL 'MQOPEN' USING HCONN, OBJECTDESC, OPTS, HOBJ, COMPOCODE REASON.<br />... <br /></pre><br /><br />In this example, an attacker could supply an option that allows shared rather than exclusive access to the queue.<br /><br />In general, do not allow user-provided or otherwise untrusted data to control sensitive values.  The leverage that an attacker gains by controlling these values is not always immediately obvious, but do not underestimate the creativity of your attacker.
