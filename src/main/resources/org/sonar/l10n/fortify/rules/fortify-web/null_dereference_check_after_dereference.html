							<p>
							  The program can potentially dereference a null pointer, thereby causing a null pointer exception.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Null pointer exceptions usually occur when one or more of the programmer's assumptions is violated. A check-after-dereference error occurs when a program dereferences an object that can be null before checking if the object is null.<br><br>Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if attackers can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, they can use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.<br><br><b>Example:</b> In the following code, the programmer assumes that the variable <code>foo</code> is not <code>null</code> and confirms this assumption by dereferencing the object. However, the programmer later contradicts the assumption by checking <code>foo</code> against <code>null</code>. If <code>foo</code> can be <code>null</code> when it is checked in the <code>if</code> statement then it can also be <code>null</code> when it is dereferenced and might cause a null pointer exception. Either the dereference is unsafe or the subsequent check is unnecessary. <br><br><pre><br>foo.setBar(val);<br>...<br>if (foo != null) {<br>	...<br>}<br></pre>
