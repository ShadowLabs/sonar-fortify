<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program defines an overly permissive custom headers policy.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  By default, Flash applications are subject to the Same Origin Policy which ensures that two SWF applications can access each other's data only if they come from the same domain. Adobe Flash allows developers to alter the policy either programmatically or via appropriate settings in the <code>crossdomain.xml</code> configuration file. Starting with Flash Player 9,0,124,0, Adobe also introduced the capability to define which custom headers Flash Player can send across domains. However, caution should be taken when defining these settings because an overly permissive custom headers policy, when applied together with the overly permissive cross-domain policy, will allow a malicious application to send headers of their choosing to the target application, potentially leading to a variety of attacks or causing errors in the execution of the application that does not know how to handle received headers.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> Below is an example of using a wildcard to specify which headers Flash Player can send across domains.<br /><br /><pre><br />  &lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;<br />    &lt;allow-http-request-headers-from domain="*" headers="*"/&gt;<br />  &lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Using the <code>*</code> as the value of the <code>headers</code> attribute indicates that any header will be sent across domains.
