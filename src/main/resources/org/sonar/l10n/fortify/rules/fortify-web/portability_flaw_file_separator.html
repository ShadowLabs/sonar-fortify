							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The use of hardcoded file separators causes portability problems.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Different operating systems use different characters as file separators. For example, Microsoft Windows systems use "\", while UNIX systems use "/". When applications have to run on different platforms, the use of hardcoded file separators can lead to incorrect execution of application logic and potentially a denial of service.<br><br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a hardcoded file separator to open a file:<br><br><pre><br>...<br>File file = new File(directoryName + "\\" + fileName);<br>...<br></pre><br>
