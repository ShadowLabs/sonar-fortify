							<p>
							  The use of deprecated or obsolete functions could indicate neglected code.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  As programming languages evolve, methods occasionally become obsolete due to:<br><br>	- Advances in the language <br><br>	- Improved understanding of how operations should perform effectively and <br>	 securely <br><br>	- Changes in the conventions that govern certain operations<br><br>Methods that are removed from a language are usually replaced by newer counterparts that perform the same task in some different and hopefully better way. <br><br><b>Example:</b> The following code constructs a string object from an array of bytes and a value that specifies the top 8 bits of each 16-bit Unicode character.<br><br><pre><br>...<br>String name = new String(nameBytes, highByte);<br>...<br></pre><br><br>In this example, the constructor may fail to correctly convert bytes to characters depending upon which charset is used to encode the string represented by <code>nameBytes</code>. Due to the evolution of the charsets used to encode strings, this constructor was deprecated and replaced by a constructor that accepts as one of its parameters the name of the <code>charset</code> used to encode the bytes for conversion. <br><br>Not all functions are deprecated or replaced because they pose a security risk. However, the presence of an obsolete function often indicates that the surrounding code has been neglected and may be in a state of disrepair. Software security has not been a priority, or even a consideration, for very long. If the program uses deprecated or obsolete functions, it raises the probability that there are security problems lurking nearby.
