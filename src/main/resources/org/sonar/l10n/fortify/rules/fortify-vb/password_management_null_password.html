<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Null passwords can compromise security.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Assigning null to password variables is a bad idea because it can allow attackers to bypass password verification or might indicate that resources are protected by an empty password.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case a null password was found in the call to <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The code below initializes a password variable to null and uses it to connect to a database. <br /><br /><pre><br />    ...<br />    Dim storedPassword As String<br />    Set storedPassword = vbNullString<br /><br />    Dim con As New ADODB.Connection<br />    Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command<br />    Dim rst As New ADODB.Recordset<br /><br />    con.ConnectionString = "Driver={Microsoft ODBC for Oracle};Server=OracleServer.world;Uid=scott;Pwd=" &amp; storedPassword &amp;";"<br />    ...<br /></pre><br /><br />If the code above succeeds, it indicates that the database user account "scott" is configured with an empty password, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Even worse, once the program has shipped, updating the account to use a non-empty password will require a code change.
