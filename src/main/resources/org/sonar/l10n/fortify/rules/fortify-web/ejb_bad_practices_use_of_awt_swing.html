							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using AWT/Swing. 
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br><br>In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br><br>"An enterprise bean must not use the AWT functionality to attempt to output information to a display, or to input information from a keyboard."<br><br>A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br><br>"Most servers do not allow direct interaction between an application program and a keyboard/display attached to the server system."
