<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Struts2 Validation file found with no corresponding Struts2 Action.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Struts2 Validation file was discovered without a matching Struts2 Action. For each ActionClass, Struts2 searches for a corresponding ActionClass-validation.xml for the necessary validation constraints. In this case, a validation file in the form of ActionClass-validation.xml was found, but ActionClass does not match an Action defined in the Struts2 configuration file.<br /><br />	    It is easy for developers to forget to update validation logic when they remove or rename action form mappings. One indication that validation logic is not being properly maintained is the presence of an unused validation form.
