<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  iOS will take a snap shot of the screen before an app is backgrounded (i.e. hitting the home button when the app is active).  The program could compromise user privacy if sensitive information is displayed when this occurs.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The UIViewController subclass, <Replace key="EnclosingClass.name"/>, does not implement the appropriate methods used to clear screen elements before a screen snap shot occurs.  This could reveal sensitive information which has been entered in input controls before an app is backgrounded.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> Input entered into iOS text controls may be stored in snap shot images taken when an app is backgrounded (i.e. the "Home" button is pressed while the app is active).<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITextField *ssnField;<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />The code in the example above indicates that the app utilizes input controls which display sensitive information.  Any information displayed in these fields can be stored in snap shot image files.  The mobile device will take screen snap shots when an app is backgrounded.  These snap shots are displayed when an app is moved to the forefront while the app is reloading to give the user an impression of snappy response.   <br /><br />The application screen snap shot files are stored on your mobile device.  If a mobile device is lost the screen snap shot files can be recovered to reveal sensitive information input into application forms.<br /><br />Private data can enter a program in a variety of ways:<br /><br />- Directly from the user in the form of a password or personal information.<br /><br />- Accessed from a database or other data store by the application.<br /><br />- Indirectly from a partner or other third party.<br /><br />- Retrieved from mobile data stores including:  Address book, snapped photos, geolocation, configuration files, archived SMS messages, etc.<br /><br />Sometimes data that is not labeled as private can have a privacy implication in a different context. For example, student identification numbers are usually not considered private because there is no explicit and publicly-available mapping to an individual student's personal information. However, if a school generates student identification based on student social security numbers, then the identification numbers should be considered private. <br /><br />Security and privacy concerns often seem to compete with each other. From a security perspective, you should record all important operations so that any anomalous activity can later be identified. However, when private data is involved, this practice can in fact create additional risk. <br /><br />Although there are many ways in which private data can be handled unsafely, a common risk stems from misplaced trust. Programmers often trust the operating environment in which a program runs, and therefore believe that it is acceptable to store private information on the file system, in the registry, or in other locally-controlled resources. However, even if access to certain resources is restricted, it does not guarantee that the individuals who do have access can be trusted with certain data. For example, in 2004, an unscrupulous employee at AOL sold approximately 92 million private customer e-mail addresses to a spammer marketing an offshore gambling web site [1].<br /><br />In response to such high-profile exploits, the collection and management of private data is becoming increasingly regulated. Depending on its location, the type of business it conducts, and the nature of any private data it handles, an organization may be required to comply with one or more of the following federal and state regulations:<br /><br />- Safe Harbor Privacy Framework [3]<br /><br />- Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA) [4]<br /><br />- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [5]<br /><br />- California SB-1386 [6]<br /><br />Despite these regulations, privacy violations continue to occur with alarming frequency.
