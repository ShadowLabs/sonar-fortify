<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Relying on a CDN to provide essential code directly to users can lead to malicious code execution.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Using a CDN to serve an application's dependent JavaScript offers many advantages over serving JavaScript from the application's own server.  These benefits include increased performance and less code maintenance for the application owner.  However, the application assumes that the CDN will deliver safe content to the browser.  If an attacker compromises a CDN, the CDN will deliver malicious code to the user's browser.  The user's browser is now executing code that the application cannot control or detect as malicious.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following ASPX code includes Microsoft's jQuery code by referencing the Microsoft CDN:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />&lt;script src="http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.4.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> The following ASPX code enables the automatic redirect of all ASP.NET framework script requests to the Microsoft Ajax CDN:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />&lt;asp:ScriptManager<br />   ID="ScriptManager1"<br />   EnableCdn="true"<br />   Runat="Server" /&gt;<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />In the above example, the ScriptManager control configures its ASPX page to automatically redirect any script requests to the appropriate CDN.
