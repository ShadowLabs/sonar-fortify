<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Hardcoding or storing a password in plaintext could result in a system compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Password management issues occur when a password is hardcoded or stored in plaintext in an application's configuration files or other data store. It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability<br /><p><br />In this case, the password is read into the program at <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code authenticates the user by reading the password that the user used to log into the database server and comparing it to an expected value.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />ip_address := OWA_SEC.get_client_ip;<br />IF ((OWA_SEC.get_user_id = 'scott') AND<br />    (OWA_SEC.get_password = 'tiger') AND <br />    (ip_address(1) = 144) and (ip_address(2) = 25)) THEN<br />        RETURN TRUE;<br />ELSE<br />        RETURN FALSE;<br />END IF;<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system.
