<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Weak cryptographic hashes cannot guarantee data integrity and should not be used in security-critical contexts.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  MD5 and SHA-1 are popular cryptographic hash algorithms often used to verify the integrity of messages and other data. Recent advances in cryptanalysis have discovered weaknesses in both algorithms. Consequently, MD5 and SHA-1 should no longer be relied upon to verify the authenticity of data in security-critical contexts.<br /><br />Techniques for breaking MD5 hashes are advanced and widely available enough that the algorithm must not be relied upon for security. In the case of SHA-1, current techniques still require a significant amount of computational power and are more difficult to implement. However, attackers have found the Achilles' heel for the algorithm, and techniques for breaking it will likely lead to the discovery of even faster attacks.
