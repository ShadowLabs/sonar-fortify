<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A SOAP message with a timestamp that does not expire is vulnerable to replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A nonce is a cryptographic random value that is sent with a message to prevent replay attacks. When a nonce is combined with timestamp (or expiration), each message is unique and is only valid for a certain amount of time, thus thwarting any attempt to retransmit an old message.
