<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Transferring program control to an untrusted application program or in an untrusted environment can cause an application to execute malicious commands on behalf of an attacker. 
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Process control vulnerabilities take two forms:<br /><br />- An attacker can change the name of the program being invoked: the attacker explicitly controls what the name of the application program is.<br /><br />- An attacker can change the environment in which the program is invoked: the attacker implicitly controls a communication area made available to the invoked program.<br /><br />In this case we are primarily concerned with the first scenario, the possibility that an attacker may be able to control the name of the program that is invoked. Process control vulnerabilities of this type occur when:<br /><br />1. Data enters the application from an untrusted source.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case the data enters at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br />2. The data is used as or as part of a string representing a program that is invoked. <br /><br /><p><br />In this case the program is invoked by <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br />3. By executing code from the invoked program, the application gives the attacker a privilege or capability that the attacker would not otherwise have. <br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code from a privileged system utility reads a value from the terminal to determine the name of the program to transfer control to.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />ACCEPT PROGNAME.<br />EXEC CICS<br />  LINK PROGRAM(PROGNAME)<br />  COMMAREA(COMA)<br />  LENGTH(LENA)<br />  DATALENGTH(LENI)<br />  SYSID('CONX')<br />END-EXEC.<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code allows an attacker to transfer control to a program and potentially execute arbitrary code with the elevated privilege of the application. Because the program does not validate the value read from the terminal, if an attacker can control this value, then they can fool the application into running malicious code and take control of the system.
