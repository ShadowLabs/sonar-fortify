							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The validator form defines a <code>validate()</code> method that fails to call <code>super.validate()</code>.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  The Struts Validator uses a form's <code>validate()</code> method to check the contents of the form properties against the constraints specified in the associated validation form. That means the following classes have a <code>validate()</code> method that is part of the validation framework:<br><br><pre><br>    ValidatorForm<br>    ValidatorActionForm<br>    DynaValidatorForm<br>    DynaValidatorActionForm<br></pre><br><br>If you create a class that extends one of these classes and if your class implements custom validation logic by overriding the <code>validate()</code> method, you must call <code>super.validate()</code> in your <code>validate()</code> implementation. If you do not, the Validation Framework cannot check the contents of the form against a validation form. In other words, the validation framework will be disabled for the given form.<br><br>Disabling the validation framework for a form exposes the application to numerous types of attacks. Unchecked input is the root cause of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.<br>
