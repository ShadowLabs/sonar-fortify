<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Trace debug information helps attackers learn about the system and plan a form of attack.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  ASP.NET applications can be configured to output trace debugging information. Trace output contains details about the request made to the current page, header information, methods and controls used on the page and the active session state. Attackers can leverage the additional information they gain from trace output to mount attacks targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.<br /><br />Trace information is enabled at the page level by setting the <code>Trace</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;page&gt;</code> directive to <code>true</code> or on the application level by adding a <code>trace</code> element in the <code>web.config</code> file and setting its <code>enabled</code> attribute to <code>true</code>.
