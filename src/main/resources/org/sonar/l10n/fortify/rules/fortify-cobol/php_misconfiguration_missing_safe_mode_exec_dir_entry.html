<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Configuring PHP to invoke arbitrary programs can allow attackers to execute malicious commands.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  When <code>safe_mode</code> is enabled, the <code>safe_mode_exec_dir</code> option restricts PHP to executing commands from only the specified directories. Although the absence of a <code>safe_mode_exec_dir</code> entry does not represent a security vulnerability itself, this added leniency can be exploited by attackers in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to make exploits more dangerous.
