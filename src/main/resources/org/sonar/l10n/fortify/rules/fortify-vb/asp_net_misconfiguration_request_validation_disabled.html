<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Use the ASP.NET validation framework to prevent vulnerabilities that result from unchecked input.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Unchecked input is the leading cause of vulnerabilities in ASP.NET applications. Unchecked input leads to cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection vulnerabilities, among others. <br /><br />To prevent such attacks, use the ASP.NET validation framework to check all program input before it is processed by the application. <br /><br />Example uses of the validation framework include checking to ensure that: <br /><br />- Phone number fields contain only valid characters in phone numbers<br /><br />- Boolean values are only "T" or "F"<br /><br />- Free-form strings are of a reasonable length and composition
