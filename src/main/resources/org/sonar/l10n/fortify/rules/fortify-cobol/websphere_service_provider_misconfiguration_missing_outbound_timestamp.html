<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A missing timestamp can leave a SOAP message open to replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Security timestamp indicates a message's freshness. If an attacker intercepts a message retransmits it at a later time, the receiver can reject the replay attack because the timestamp will indicate that the message is stale. Optionally, timestamps can include an expiration attribute which places a hard limit on how long security semantics are valid.<br /><br />To prevent attackers from tampering with timestamps, timestamps should be signed. Without a signed timestamp, it might be possible to intercept a SOAP message, modify the timestamp, and send the message on without the receiver's knowledge. Under these circumstances, an attacker can potentially trick a recipient into accepting a malicious message.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, the WebSphere configuration file <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> is missing a <code>&lt;timestamp&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;addTimestamp&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;securityResponseGeneratorServiceConfig&gt;</code> tag.<br /></p>
