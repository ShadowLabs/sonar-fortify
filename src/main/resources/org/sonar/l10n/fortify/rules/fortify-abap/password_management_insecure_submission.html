<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Submitting a password as part of an HTTP GET request will cause the password to be displayed, logged, or stored in a cache.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  By convention, the parameters associated with an HTTP GET request are not treated as sensitive data, so web servers log them, proxies cache them, and web browsers do not make an effort to conceal them. Sending a password or other sensitive data as part of an HTTP GET will likely cause the data to be mishandled and potentially revealed to an attacker.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> In the example below, new user password is submited via an HTTP GET request.<br /><pre><br />&lt;form method="get"&gt;<br />  Name of new user: &lt;input type="text" name="username"&gt;<br />  Password for new user: &lt;input type="password" name="user_passwd"&gt;<br />  &lt;input type="submit" name="action" value="Create User"&gt;<br />&lt;/form&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Also, note that the default value of the <code>method</code> attributed is <code>GET</code>, thus omitting the attribute results in the same outcome.
