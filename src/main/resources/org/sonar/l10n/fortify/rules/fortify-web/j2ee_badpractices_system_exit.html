							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  A web application should not attempt to shut down its container.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is never a good idea for a web application to attempt to shut down the application container. A call to <code>System.exit()</code> is probably part of leftover debug code or code imported from a non-J2EE application.
