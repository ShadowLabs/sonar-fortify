							<p>
							  Without proper access control, executing a SQL statement that contains a user-controlled primary key can allow an attacker to view unauthorized records.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Database access control errors occur when:<br><br>1.	Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br><br><br>2.	The data is used to specify the value of a primary key in a SQL query. <br><br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a parameterized statement, which escapes metacharacters and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities, to construct and execute a SQL query that searches for an invoice matching the specified identifier [1]. The identifier is selected from a list of all invoices associated with the current authenticated user. <br><br><pre><br>...<br>id = Integer.decode(request.getParameter("invoiceID"));<br>String query = "SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE id = ?";<br>PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);<br>stmt.setInt(1, id);<br>ResultSet results = stmt.execute();<br>...<br></pre><br><br>The problem is that the developer has failed to consider all of the possible values of <code>id</code>. Although the interface generates a list of invoice identifiers that belong to the current user, an attacker can bypass this interface to request any desired invoice. Because the code in this example does not check to ensure that the user has permission to access the requested invoice, it will display any invoice, even if it does not belong to the current user.<br><br>A number of modern web frameworks provide mechanisms for performing validation of user input. Struts and Struts 2 are among them. To highlight the unvalidated sources of input, the rulepacks dynamically re-prioritize the issues reported by HP Fortify Static Code Analyzer by lowering their probability of exploit and providing pointers to the supporting evidence whenever the framework validation mechanism is in use. We refer to this feature as Context-Sensitive Ranking. To further assist the HP Fortify user with the auditing process, the Fortify Security Research Group makes available the Data Validation project template that groups the issues into folders based on the validation mechanism applied to their source of input.
