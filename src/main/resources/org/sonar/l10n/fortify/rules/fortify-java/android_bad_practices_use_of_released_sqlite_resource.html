<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The code references the Android database handler after it has already been released.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The code attempts to use the Android SQLite database handler after the it has already been closed. Any further references to the handler without re-establishing the database connection will throw an exception, and can cause the application to crash if the exception is not caught.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code might be from a program that caches user values temporarily in memory, but can call <code>flushUpdates()</code> to commit the changes to disk. The method properly closes the database handler after writing updates to the database. However, when <code>flushUpdates()</code> is called again, the database object is referenced again before reinitializing it.<br /><br /><pre><br />public class ReuseDBActivity extends Activity {<br />  private myDBHelper dbHelper;<br />  private SQLiteDatabase db;<br /><br />  @Override<br />  public void onCreate(Bundle state) {<br />      ...<br />      db = dbHelper.getWritableDatabase();<br />      ...<br />  }<br />  ...<br /><br />  private void flushUpdates() {<br />      db.insert(cached_data);     // flush cached data<br />      dbHelper.close();<br />  }<br />  ...<br />}<br /></pre>
