<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Sending a password as part of an HTTP redirect will cause the password to be displayed, logged, or stored in a cache.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  An HTTP redirect causes the user's web browser to issue an HTTP GET request. By convention, the parameters associated with an HTTP GET are not treated as sensitive data, so web servers log them, proxies cache them, and web browsers do not make an effort to conceal them. Sending a password or other sensitive data as part of a redirect will likely cause the data to be mishandled and potentially revealed to an attacker.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> <br /><pre><br />response.sendRedirect("j_security_check?j_username="+usr+"&amp;j_password="+pass);<br /></pre>
