<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Empty passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to assign an empty string to a password variable. If the empty password is used to successfully authenticate against another system, then the corresponding account's security is likely compromised because it accepts an empty password. If the empty password is merely a placeholder until a legitimate value can be assigned to the variable, then it can confuse anyone unfamiliar with the code and potentially cause problems on unexpected control flow paths.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case an empty password was found in the call to <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The code below attempts to connect to a database with an empty password. <br /><pre><br />&lt;?php<br />    ...<br />    $connection = mysql_connect($host, 'scott', '');<br />    ...<br />?&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />If the code in the Example succeeds, it indicates that the database user account "scott" is configured with an empty password, which can be easily guessed by an attacker. Even worse, once the program has shipped, updating the account to use a non-empty password will require a code change.
