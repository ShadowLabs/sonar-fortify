							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  An Action Field was found without a corresponding validation definition.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  One or more Action Fields do not have a corresponding validation definition. Each field should have an explicit validation routine referenced in ActionClass-validation.xml. <br><br>	    	    It is easy for developers to forget to update validation logic when they remove or rename action form mappings. One indication that validation logic is not being properly maintained is the lack of a validator definition.<br><br>It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the rest of the application. Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack. <br><br>
