<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program violates the Enterprise JavaBeans specification by using sockets.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The Enterprise JavaBeans specification requires that every bean provider follow a set of programming guidelines designed to ensure that the bean will be portable and behave consistently in any EJB container [1]. <br /><br />In this case, the program violates the following EJB guideline:<br /><br />"An enterprise bean must not attempt to listen on a socket, accept connections on a socket, or use a socket for multicast."<br /><br />A requirement that the specification justifies in the following way: <br /><br />"The EJB architecture allows an enterprise bean instance to be a network socket client, but it does not allow it to be a network server. Allowing the instance to become a network server would conflict with the basic function of the enterprise bean-- to serve the EJB clients."
