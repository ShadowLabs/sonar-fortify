<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An attacker might be able to create unexpected control flow paths through the application, potentially bypassing security checks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  If an attacker can supply values that the application then uses to determine which class to instantiate or which method to invoke, the potential exists for the attacker to create control flow paths through the application that were not intended by the application developers. This attack vector may allow the attacker to bypass authentication or access control checks or otherwise cause the application to behave in an unexpected manner. Even the ability to control the arguments passed to a given method or constructor may give a wily attacker the edge necessary to mount a successful attack.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case the untrusted data enters the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>. It is passed to the reflection API at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> Programmers often use reflection to implement command dispatchers. The following example shows a command dispatcher that does not utilize reflection:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />Dim ctl As String<br />Dim ao As New Worker()<br />ctl = Request.Form("ctl")<br />If (String.Compare(ctl,"Add") = 0) Then<br />        ao.DoAddCommand(Request)<br />Else If (String.Compare(ctl,"Modify") = 0) Then<br />        ao.DoModifyCommand(Request)<br />Else<br />        App.EventLog("No Action Found", 4)<br />End If<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />A programmer might refactor this code to use reflection as follows:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />Dim ctl As String<br />Dim ao As New Worker()<br />ctl = Request.Form("ctl")<br />CallByName(ao, ctl, vbMethod, Request)<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />The refactoring initially appears to offer a number of advantages. There are fewer lines of code, the <code>if/else</code> blocks have been entirely eliminated, and it is now possible to add new command types without modifying the command dispatcher.<br /><br />However, the refactoring allows an attacker to invoke any method implemented by the <code>Worker</code> object. If the command dispatcher is responsible for access control, then whenever programmers create a new method in the <code>Worker</code> class, they must remember to modify the dispatcher's access control logic. If this access control logic becomes stale, then some <code>Worker</code> methods will not have any access control.<br /><br />One way to address this access control problem is to make the <code>Worker</code> object responsible for performing the access control check. An example of the re-refactored code follows:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />Dim ctl As String<br />Dim ao As New Worker()<br />ctl = Request.Form("ctl")<br /><b>If (ao.checkAccessControl(ctl,Request) = True) Then</b><br />        CallByName(ao, "Do" &amp; ctl &amp; "Command", vbMethod, Request)<br />End If<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />Although this is an improvement, it encourages a decentralized approach to access control, which makes it easier for programmers to make access control mistakes.
