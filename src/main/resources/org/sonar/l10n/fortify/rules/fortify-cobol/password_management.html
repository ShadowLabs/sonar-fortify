<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Storing a password in plaintext can result in a system compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. <br /><p><br />In this case, the password is read into the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/> and used to access a resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code reads a password from a properties file and uses the password to connect to a database.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />01  RECORD.<br />     05  UID              PIC X(10).<br />     05  PWD              PIC X(10).<br />...<br />EXEC CICS<br />  READ<br />  FILE('CFG')<br />  INTO(RECORD)<br />  RIDFLD(ACCTNO)<br />  ...<br />END-EXEC.<br /><br />EXEC SQL<br />  CONNECT :UID<br />  IDENTIFIED BY :PWD<br />  AT :MYCONN<br />  USING :MYSERVER<br />END-EXEC.<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to <code>CFG</code> can read the value of password. If a devious employee has access to this information, they can use it to break into the system.
