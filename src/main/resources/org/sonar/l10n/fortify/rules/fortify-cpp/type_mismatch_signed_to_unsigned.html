<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The function is declared to return an unsigned number but returns a signed value.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is dangerous to rely on implicit casts between signed and unsigned numbers because the result can take on an unexpected value and violate weak assumptions made elsewhere in the program. <br /><br /><b>Example:</b> In this example, depending on the return value of <code>accecssmainframe()</code>, the variable <code>amount</code> can hold a negative value when it is returned. Because the function is declared to return an unsigned value, <code>amount</code> will be implicitly cast to an unsigned number. <br /><br /><pre><br />unsigned int readdata () {<br />	int amount = 0; <br />...<br />amount = accessmainframe(); <br />...<br />	return amount;<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />If the return value of <code>accessmainframe()</code> is -1, then the return value of <code>readdata()</code> will be 4,294,967,295 on a system that uses 32-bit integers.<br /><br />Conversion between signed and unsigned values can lead to a variety of errors, but from a security standpoint is most commonly associated with integer overflow and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
