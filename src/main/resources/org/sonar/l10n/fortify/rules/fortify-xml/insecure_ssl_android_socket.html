<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The method fails to make SSL verification checks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Calls to <code>createSocket()</code>, that take in InetAddress as a function parameter, do not perform hostname verification. <br /><br />Similarily, calls to <code>getInsecure()</code> returns a SSL socket factory with all SSL checks disabled.<br /><br />Both of these render the application susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle attack. <br /><br />For example the application when trying to connect to https://safesecureserver.banking.com would readily accept a certificate issued to https://hackedserver.banking.com.The application would now potentially leak sensitive user information on a broken SSL connection to the hacked server.
