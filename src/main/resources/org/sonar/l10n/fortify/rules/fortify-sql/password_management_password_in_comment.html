<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Hardcoded passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br /><p><br />In this case the hardcoded password appears in the comment in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following comment specifies the default password to connect to a database:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />-- Default username for database connection is "scott" <br />-- Default password for database connection is "tiger"<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the database user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system.
