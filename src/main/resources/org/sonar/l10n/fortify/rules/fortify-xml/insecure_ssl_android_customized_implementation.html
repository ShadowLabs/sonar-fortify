<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The application implements a custom SSL interface.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The SSL standard provides guidelines on how to perform SSL validation checks on the client side.  These are however, not part of the standard. Thus, the implementation of the validation logic is left to the application developer. <br /><br />Research has shown that the complexity and open nature of the SSL standard specification has several pitfalls making it difficult to get a flawless custom SSL implementation.  A large percentage of the Android applications that use custom SSL implementations are deficient in providing a secure communications channel, leaving the applications vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
