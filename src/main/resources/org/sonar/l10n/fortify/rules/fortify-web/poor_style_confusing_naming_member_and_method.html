							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The class contains a field and a method with the same name.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  It is confusing to have a member field and a method with the same name. It makes it easy for a programmer to accidentally call the method when attempting to access the field or vice versa.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> <br><br><pre><br>public class Totaller {<br>  private int total;<br>  public int total() {<br>    ...<br>  }<br>}<br></pre>
