							<p>
							  This field is never used.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  This field is never accessed, except perhaps by dead code. Dead code is defined as code that is never directly or indirectly executed by a public method. It is likely that the field is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused field points out a bug.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The field named <code>glue</code> is not used in the following class. The author of the class has accidentally put quotes around the field name, transforming it into a string constant.<br><br><pre><br>public class Dead {<br><br>  String glue;<br><br>  public String getGlue() {<br>    return "glue";<br>  }<br><br>}<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The field named <code>glue</code> is used in the following class, but only from a method that is never called.<br><br><pre><br>public class Dead {<br><br>  String glue;<br><br>  private String getGlue() {<br>    return glue;<br>  }<br><br>}<br></pre>
