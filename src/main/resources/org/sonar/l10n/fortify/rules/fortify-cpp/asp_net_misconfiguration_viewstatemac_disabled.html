<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Disabling the view state message authentication check (MAC) can allow attackers to modify the View State.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  In ASP.NET, the view state is a mechanism to persist state in web forms across postbacks. Data stored in the view state is not trustworthy because there is no mechanism for preventing replay attacks. Trusting the view state is particularly dangerous when the view state message authentication check is disabled. Disabling this check allows attackers to make arbitrary changes to the data stored in the view state and can open the door for attacks against code that trusts the view state. Attackers might use this kind of error to defeat authentication checks or alter item pricing.<br /><p><br />In this case, the <code>enableViewStateMac</code> attribute is set to <code>false</code> on the <code>&lt;pages&gt;</code> tag defined in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p>
