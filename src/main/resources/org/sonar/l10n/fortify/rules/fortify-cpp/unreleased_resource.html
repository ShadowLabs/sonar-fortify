<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource. <br /><p><br />In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not always released.<br /></p><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following function does not close the file handle it opens if an error occurs. If the process is long-lived, the process can run out of file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />int decodeFile(char* fName)<br />{<br />    char buf[BUF_SZ];<br />    FILE* f = fopen(fName, "r");<br />    <br />    if (!f) {<br />        printf("cannot open %s\n", fName);<br />        return DECODE_FAIL;<br />    } else {<br />        while (fgets(buf, BUF_SZ, f)) {<br />            if (!checkChecksum(buf)) {<br />              return DECODE_FAIL;<br />            } else {<br />              decodeBlock(buf);<br />            }<br />        }<br />    }<br />    fclose(f);<br />    return DECODE_SUCCESS;<br />}<br /></pre>
