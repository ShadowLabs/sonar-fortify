<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Allowing user input to control paths used in filesystem operations could enable an attacker to access or modify otherwise protected system resources.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Path manipulation errors occur when the following two conditions are met:<br /><br />1. An attacker can specify a path used in an operation on the filesystem. <br /><br />2. By specifying the resource, the attacker gains a capability that would not otherwise be permitted.<br /><br />For example, the program may give the attacker the ability to overwrite the specified file or run with a configuration controlled by the attacker. <br /><p><br />In this case, the attacker can specify the value that enters the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>, and this value is used to access a filesystem resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><IfDef var="ConditionalDescriptions"><br /> <p><br />  <ConditionalText condition="taint:number"><br />Even though the data in this case is a number, it is unvalidated and thus still considered malicious, hence the vulnerability is still reported but with reduced priority values.<br />  </ConditionalText><br /> </p><br /></IfDef><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses input from an HTML form to update or possibly delete a record from a file.<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />EXEC CICS<br />  WEB READ<br />  FORMFIELD(FILE)<br />  VALUE(FILENAME)<br />  ...<br />END-EXEC.<br /><br />EXEC CICS<br />  READ<br />  FILE(FILENAME)<br />  INTO(RECORD)<br />  RIDFLD(ACCTNO)<br />  UPDATE<br />  ...<br />END-EXEC.<br />...<br /></pre>
