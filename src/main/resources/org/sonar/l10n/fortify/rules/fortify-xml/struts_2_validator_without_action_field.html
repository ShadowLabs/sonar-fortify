<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Struts2 validator definition refers to an action field that does not exist.<br />	    <br />	    It is easy for developers to forget to update validation logic when they remove or rename action form mappings. One indication that validation logic is not being properly maintained is the presence of an orphaned validator definition.
