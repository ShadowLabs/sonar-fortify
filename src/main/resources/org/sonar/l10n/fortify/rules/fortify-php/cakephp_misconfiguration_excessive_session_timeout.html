<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An overly long session timeout gives attackers more time to potentially compromise user accounts.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The longer a session stays open, the larger the window of opportunity an attacker has to compromise user accounts. While a session remains active, an attacker might be able to brute force a user's password, crack a user's wireless encryption key, or commandeer a session from an open browser. Longer session timeouts can also prevent memory from being released and eventually result in a denial of service if a sufficiently large number of sessions are created.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following example shows CakePHP configured with <code>low</code> session security. <br /><pre><br />    Configure::write('Security.level', 'low');<br /></pre><br /><br />In conjunction with the <code>Session.timeout</code> setting, the <code>Security.level</code> settings define how long a session is valid. The actual session timeout time is a equal to the <code>Session.timeout</code> times one of the following multiples:<br /><br />'high' = x 10<br />'medium' = x 100<br />'low' = x 300
