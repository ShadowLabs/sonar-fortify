<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Turning off WS-Security makes it hard to guarantee message integrity and confidentiality.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The Rampart WS-Security module is not enabled. WS-Security is an extension of SOAP that provides end-to-end message integrity and confidentiality regardless of the transport protocol. When WS-Security is not used, messages rely on transport security for integrity and confidentiality. If a service relays messages to other services, messages are exposed to the weakest transport mechanism used between relay points. WS-Security eliminates the transport security dependency and builds security into the message itself.
