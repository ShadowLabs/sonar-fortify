<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Calling <code>sleep()</code> while holding a lock can cause a loss of performance and might cause a deadlock.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  If multiple threads are trying to obtain a lock on a resource, calling <code>sleep()</code> while holding a lock can cause all of the other threads to wait for the resource to be released, which can result in degraded performance and deadlock. <br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code calls <code>sleep()</code> while holding a lock.<br /><pre><br />ReentrantLock rl = new ReentrantLock();<br />...<br />rl.lock();<br />Thread.sleep(500);<br />...<br />rl.unlock();<br /></pre>
