<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This synchronized block contains no statements; it is unlikely the synchronization achieves the intended effect.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Synchronization in Java can be tricky. An empty synchronized block is often a sign that a programmer is wrestling with synchronization but has not yet achieved the result they intend.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> <br /><br /><pre><br />synchronized(this) { }<br /></pre>
