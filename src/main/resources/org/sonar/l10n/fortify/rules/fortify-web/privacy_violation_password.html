							<p>
							  <Paragraph>The method <Replace key="EnclosingFunction.name"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> writes the password in plaintext to standard output, <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>. A viewed password endangers system security.</Paragraph>
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  A password need not be viewable to its owner, and must not be viewable to others. If a password is displayed, anyone in the vicinity could see and use it to compromise the system. In computer security, shoulder surfing refers to using direct observation techniques, such as looking over someone's shoulder, to get information. Shoulder surfing is particularly effective in crowded, public environments.This threat particularly applies to mobile devices, which are generally intended for use in all environments, both private or public.<br>
