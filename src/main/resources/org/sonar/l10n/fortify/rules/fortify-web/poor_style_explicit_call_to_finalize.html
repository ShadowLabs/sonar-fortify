							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  The <code>finalize()</code> method should only be called by the JVM after the object has been garbage collected.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  While the Java Language Specification allows an object's <code>finalize()</code> method to be called from outside the finalizer, doing so is usually a bad idea. For example, calling <code>finalize()</code> explicitly means that <code>finalize()</code> will be called more than once: the first time will be the explicit call and the last time will be the call that is made after the object is garbage collected.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b>  The following code fragment calls <code>finalize()</code> explicitly:<br><br><pre><br>// time to clean up<br>widget.finalize();<br></pre>
