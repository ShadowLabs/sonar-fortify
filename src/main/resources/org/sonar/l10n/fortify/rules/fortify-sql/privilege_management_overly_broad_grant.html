<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Granting all privileges on an object may give users more privileges than expected.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Using the <code>ALL PRIVILEGES</code> or <code>ALL</code> option will grant the user all of the permissions that can be applied to an object. The programmer may not be aware of all of the privileges being granted.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> An administrator may want to give a user the ability to update the data in the procedure. <br /><br /><pre><br />GRANT ALL ON employees TO john_doe;<br /></pre><br /><br />In addition to the ability to select, update, add, and remove rows, <code>john_doe</code> now has permission to change the definition of the table.
