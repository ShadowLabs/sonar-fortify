<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Do not use <code>VirtualLock</code> to lock pages that contain sensitive data. The function is not always implemented.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Heap inspection vulnerabilities occur when sensitive data, such as a password or an encryption key, can be exposed to an attacker because they are not removed from memory.<br /><br />The <code>VirtualLock</code> function is intended to lock pages in memory to prevent them from being paged to disk. However, on Windows 95/98/ME the function is implemented as stub only and has no effect. <br /><br /><p><br />In this case <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> is called in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p>
