							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  A class member has the same name as the enclosing class.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Java allows class members to share the same name as the enclosing class, but taking advantage of this capability usually results in confusing and buggy code. <br><br><b>Example 1:</b> Consider the following class. Imagine trying to debug a problem with it.<br><br><pre><br>public class Name {<br><br>  private Name Name;<br><br>  public Name getName() {<br>    return Name.Name;<br>  }<br>}<br></pre><br><br><b>Example 2:</b> The following code excerpt from WebGoat demonstrates a bug that manifests itself as a confusing naming issue [1].<br><br><pre><br>public class CreateDB<br>{<br>	public void CreateDB() { }<br>	...<br>}<br></pre><br><br>The author intended to create a constructor for the <code>CreateDB</code> class, but inadvertently wrote in a return type (<code>void</code>) and created a regular method instead.
