<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The <code>_alloca()</code> function can throw a stack overflow exception, potentially causing the program to crash.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The <code>_alloca()</code> function allocates memory on the stack. If an allocation request is too large for the available stack space, <code>_alloca()</code> throws an exception. If the exception is not caught, the program will crash, potentially enabling a denial of service attack.<br /><p><br />In this case <code>_alloca()</code> is called in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><code>_alloca()</code> has been deprecated as of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005(R). It has been replaced with the more secure <code>_alloca_s()</code>.
