							<p>
							  Servlet member fields might allow one user to see another user's data.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Many Servlet developers do not understand that a Servlet is a singleton. There is only one instance of the Servlet, and that single instance is used and re-used to handle multiple requests that are processed simultaneously by different threads. <br><br>A common result of this misunderstanding is that developers use Servlet member fields in such a way that one user may inadvertently see another user's data. In other words, storing user data in Servlet member fields introduces a data access race condition.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following Servlet stores the value of a request parameter in a member field and then later echoes the parameter value to the response output stream.<br><br><pre><br>public class GuestBook extends HttpServlet {<br><br>   String name;<br><br>   protected void doPost (HttpServletRequest req,<br>                       HttpServletResponse res) {<br>     name = req.getParameter("name");<br>     ...<br>     out.println(name + ", thanks for visiting!");<br>   }<br>}<br></pre><br><br>While this code will work perfectly in a single-user environment, if two users access the Servlet at approximately the same time, it is possible for the two request handler threads to interleave in the following way:<br><br>	Thread 1:	assign "<code>Dick</code>" to <code>name</code><br>	Thread 2:	assign "<code>Jane</code>" to <code>name</code><br>	Thread 1:	print "<code>Jane, thanks for visiting!</code>"<br>	Thread 2:	print "<code>Jane, thanks for visiting!</code>"<br><br> Thereby showing the first user the second user's name.
