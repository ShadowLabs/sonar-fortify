<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The lack of a signature means the integrity of SOAP messages cannot be guaranteed.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Any part of a message that is not signed has the potential to be intercepted and modified without the knowledge of the sender or the receiver. Without a signature, the receiver cannot cryptographically verify that the contents of a message really originated with the sender.<br /><br />The following client configuration tells Axis 2 to accept unsigned messages:<br /><pre><br />&lt;axisconfig name=&quot;AxisJava2.0&quot;&gt;<br />...<br />	&lt;parameter name=&quot;InflowSecurity&quot;&gt;<br />		&lt;action&gt;<br />			&lt;items&gt;Timestamp Encrypt&lt;/items&gt;<br />			...<br />		&lt;/action&gt;<br />	&lt;/parameter&gt;<br />&lt;/axisconfig&gt;<br /></pre>
