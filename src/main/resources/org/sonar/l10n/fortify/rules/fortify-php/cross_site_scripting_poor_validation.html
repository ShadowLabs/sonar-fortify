<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Relying on HTML, XML and other types of encoding to validate user input can result in the browser executing malicious code.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The use of certain encoding functions, such as <code>htmlspecialchars()</code> or <code>htmlentities()</code>, will prevent some, but not all cross-site scripting attacks. Depending on the context in which the data appear, characters beyond the basic &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, and " that are HTML-encoded and those beyond &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, ", and ' (only when <code>ENT_QUOTES</code> is set) that are XML-encoded may take on meta-meaning. Relying on such encoding functions is equivalent to using a weak blacklist to prevent cross-site scripting and might allow an attacker to inject malicious code that will be executed in the browser. Because accurately identifying the context in which the data appear statically is not always possible, the HP Fortify Secure Coding Rulepacks reports cross-site scripting findings even when encoding is applied and presents them as Cross-Site Scripting: Poor Validation issues.<br /><br />Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when:<br /><br />1. Data enters a web application through an untrusted source. In the case of Reflected XSS, an untrusted source is most frequently a web request, and in the case of Persistent (a.k.a. Stored) XSS -- it is the results of a database query.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case the data enters at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br />2. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious code. <br /><p><br />In this case the data is weakly validated with HTML encoding and written out to a browser at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br />The malicious content sent to the web browser often takes the form of a segment of JavaScript, but may also include HTML, Flash or any other type of code that the browser may execute. The variety of attacks based on XSS is almost limitless, but they commonly include transmitting private data like cookies or other session information to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user's machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code segment reads in the <code>text</code> parameter, from an HTTP request, HTML-encodes it, and displays it in an alert box in between script tags.<br /><br /><pre><br />&lt;?php<br />    $var=$_GET['text'];<br />    ...<br />    $var2=htmlspecialchars($var);<br />    echo "&lt;script&gt;alert('$var2')&lt;/script&gt;";<br />?&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />The code in this example operates correctly if <code>text</code> contains only standard alphanumeric text. If <code>text</code> has a single quote, a round bracket and a semicolon, it ends the <code>alert</code> textbox whereafter the code will be executed.<br /><br />Initially this might not appear to be much of a vulnerability. After all, why would someone enter a URL that causes malicious code to run on their own computer? The real danger is that an attacker will create the malicious URL, then use e-mail or social engineering tricks to lure victims into visiting a link to the URL. When victims click the link, they unwittingly reflect the malicious content through the vulnerable web application back to their own computers. This mechanism of exploiting vulnerable web applications is known as Reflected XSS.<br /><br />As the examples demonstrate, XSS vulnerabilities are caused by code that includes unvalidated data in an HTTP response. There are three vectors by which an XSS attack can reach a victim:<br /><br />- As in Example 1, data is read directly from the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a user to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces victims to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the user, the content is executed and proceeds to transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the user's machine to the attacker or perform other nefarious activities.<br /><br />- The application stores dangerous data in a database or other trusted data store. The dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. Persistent XSS exploits occur when an attacker injects dangerous content into a data store that is later read and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user.<br /><br />- A source outside the application stores dangerous data in a database or other data store, and the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application as trusted data and included in dynamic content.
