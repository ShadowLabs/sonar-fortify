<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's configuration files or other data store. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.<br /><p><br />In this case, the password is read into the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/> and used to access a resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code reads a password from the registry and uses the password to create a new network credential. <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />string value = regKey.GetValue(passKey).ToString());<br />byte[] decVal = Convert.FromBase64String(value);<br />NetworkCredential netCred = <br />  new NetworkCredential(username,decVal.toString(),domain);<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to the registry key used to store the password can read the value of <code>password</code>. If a devious employee has access to this information, they can use it to break into the system.
