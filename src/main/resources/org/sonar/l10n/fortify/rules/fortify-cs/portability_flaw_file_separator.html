<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The use of hardcoded file separators causes portability problems.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Different operating systems use different characters as file separators. For example, Microsoft Windows systems use "\", while UNIX systems use "/". When applications have to run on different platforms, the use of hardcoded file separators can lead to incorrect execution of application logic and potentially a denial of service.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case a hardcoded file separator was used in the call to <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code uses a hardcoded file separator to open a file:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />FileStream f = File.Create(directoryName + "\\" + fileName);<br />...<br /></pre>
