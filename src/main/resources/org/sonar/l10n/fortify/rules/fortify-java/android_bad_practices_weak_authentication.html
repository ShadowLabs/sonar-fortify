<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  <p>The program uses private and/or device specific information to generate a universally unique identifier.</p>
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Hardware and device specific identifiers persist across data wipes and factory resets.  One should not rely on these to generate unique identifiers that are used to authorize or authenticate users.    <br /><br />Moreover, leakage of universally unique identifiers, that can be associated with personal information, pose a threat to user privacy and security.
