							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  This looks like an effort to override a common Java method, but it probably does not have the intended effect.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  This method's name is similar to a common Java method name, but it is either spelled incorrectly or the argument list causes it to not override the intended method.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following method is meant to override <code>Object.equals()</code>:<br><br><pre><br>public boolean equals(Object obj1, Object obj2) {<br>  ...<br>}<br></pre><br><br>But since <code>Object.equals()</code> only takes a single argument, the method above is never called.
