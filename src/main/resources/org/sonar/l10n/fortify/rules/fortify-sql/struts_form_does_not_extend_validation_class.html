<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  All Struts forms should extend a Validator class.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  In order to use the Struts Validator, a form must extend one of the following:<br />    <br /><pre><br />ValidatorForm<br />ValidatorActionForm<br />DynaValidatorActionForm<br />DynaValidaorForm<br /></pre><br /><br />You must extend one of these classes because the Struts Validator ties in to your application by implementing the <code>validate()</code> method in these classes.<br /><br />Forms derived from the following classes <b>cannot</b> use the Struts Validator:<br /><br /><pre><br />ActionForm<br />DynaActionForm<br /></pre><br /><br />Bypassing the validation framework for a form exposes the application to numerous types of attacks. Unchecked input is the root cause of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.
