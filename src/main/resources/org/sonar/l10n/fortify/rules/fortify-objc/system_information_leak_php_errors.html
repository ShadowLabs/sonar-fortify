<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Revealing data or debugging information helps an adversary learn about the system and form a plan of attack.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  If the <code>display_errors</code> option is enabled, errors are displayed to the Web, which can illustrate potential weaknesses to an attacker. For example, a database error message can reveal that the application is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. Other error messages can reveal more oblique clues about the system.
