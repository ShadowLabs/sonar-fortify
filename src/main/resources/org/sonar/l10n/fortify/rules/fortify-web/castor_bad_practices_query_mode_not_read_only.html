							<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
							<p>
							  A Castor query that is not read-only can have performance implications.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  Even if castor creates a lock on an object it does not prevent other threads from reading or writing to it. Read-only queries are also about 7 times faster compared with default shared mode.<br><br><b>Example 1:</b> The following example specifies the query mode as <code>SHARED</code> which allows both read and write access.<br><pre><br>results = query.execute(Database.SHARED);<br></pre><br><br>
