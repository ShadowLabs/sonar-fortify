<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A cookie with an overly broad domain opens an application to attacks through other applications.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Developers often set cookies to be active across a base domain like "<code>.example.com</code>". This exposes the cookie to all web applications on the base domain and any sub-domains. Since cookies often carry sensitive information such as session identifiers, sharing cookies across applications can lead a vulnerability in one application to cause a compromise in another.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b><br />Imagine you have a secure application deployed at <code>http://secure.example.com/</code>, and the application sets a session ID cookie with domain "<code>.example.com</code>" when a user logs in.<br /><br />For example:<br /><pre><br />  HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("sessionID", sessionID);<br />  cookie.Domain = ".example.com";<br /></pre><br /><br />Suppose you have another, less secure, application at <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code> and it contains a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Any user authenticated to <code>http://secure.example.com</code> that browses to <code>http://insecure.example.com</code> risks exposing their session cookie from <code>http://secure.example.com</code>.<br /><br />In addition to reading a cookie, it might be possible for attackers to perform a Cookie Poisoning attack by using <code>insecure.example.com</code> to create its own overly broad cookie that overwrites the cookie from <code>secure.example.com</code>.
