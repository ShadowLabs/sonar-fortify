<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  An easy-to-guess Web SQL database name can lead to data theft and database corruption by unauthorized parties.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  One of the features of HTML5 is the ability to store data in a client-side SQL database. The main piece of information required to start writing to and reading from the database is its name. Therefore, it is crucial that the name of the database is a unique string that differs from user to user. If the name of the database is easy to guess, unauthorized parties, such as other users, might be able to steal sensitive data or corrupt the database entries.<br /><p><br />In this case the database is accessed at <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses an easy-to-guess database name:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />var db = openDatabase('mydb', '1.0', 'Test DB', 2 * 1024 * 1024);<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who can guess the database name to be <code>'mydb'</code> will be able to accesses it.
