<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Determining an object's type based on its class name can lead to unexpected behavior or allow an attacker to inject a malicious class.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Attackers may deliberately duplicate class names in order to cause a program to execute malicious code. For this reason, class names are not good type identifiers and should not be used as the basis for granting trust to a given object. <br /><br />Example 1: The following code opts to trust or distrust input from an <code>inputReader</code> object based on its class name. If an attacker is able to supply an implementation of <code>inputReader</code> that executes malicious commands, this code will be unable to differentiate the benign and malicious versions of the object. <br /><br /><pre><br />if (inputReader.getClass().getName().equals("TrustedName"))<br />{<br />   input = inputReader.getInput();<br />   ...<br />}<br /></pre>
