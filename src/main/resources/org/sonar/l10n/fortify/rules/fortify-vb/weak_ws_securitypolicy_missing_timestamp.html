<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A missing timestamp can leave a SOAP message open to replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Security timestamp indicates the freshness of a message's security data. If an attacker intercepts a message retransmits it at a later time, the receiver can reject the replay attack because the timestamp will indicate that the message is stale.<br /><br />To prevent attackers from tampering with timestamps, timestamps should be signed. Without a signed timestamp, an attacker could intercept a SOAP message, modify the timestamp, and send the message on without the receiver's knowledge. Under these circumstances, an attacker can trick a recipient into accepting a malicious message.<br />  <br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following WS-SecurityPolicy policy entry has the <code>&lt;IncludeTimestamp&gt;</code> tag commented out:<br /><pre><br />  &lt;sp:AsymmetricBinding&gt;<br />    &lt;wsp:Policy&gt;<br />      ...<br />      &lt;!--&lt;sp:IncludeTimestamp/&gt;--&gt;<br />      &lt;sp:ProtectTokens/&gt;<br />      &lt;sp:OnlySignEntireHeadersAndBody/&gt;<br />    &lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;<br />  &lt;/sp:AsymmetricBinding&gt;<br /></pre>
