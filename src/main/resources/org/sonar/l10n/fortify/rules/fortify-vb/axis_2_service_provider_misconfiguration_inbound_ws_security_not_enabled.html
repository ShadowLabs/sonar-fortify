<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Service providers that don't require WS-Security might not be able to guarantee message integrity or confidentiality.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  WS-Security is an enhancement to SOAP that provides end-to-end message integrity and confidentiality regardless of the transport protocol. When WS-Security is not used, messages rely on transport security for integrity and confidentiality. If a service relays messages to other services, messages are exposed to the weakest transport mechanism used between relay points. WS-Security removes the transport security dependency and secures the message itself.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, the file <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> does not contain an <code>InflowSecurity</code> parameter.</p> The absence of an <code>InflowSecurity</code> parameter in the Apache Axis 2 configuration file indicates that inbound message security is not enabled.
