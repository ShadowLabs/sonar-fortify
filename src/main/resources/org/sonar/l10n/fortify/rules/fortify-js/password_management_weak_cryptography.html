<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Obscuring a password with a trivial encoding does not protect the password.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Password management issues occur when a password is stored in plaintext in an application's properties or configuration file. A programmer can attempt to remedy the password management problem by obscuring the password with an encoding function, such as base 64 encoding, but this effort does not adequately protect the password.<br /><p><br />In this case, the password is read into the program at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/> and used to access a resource at <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses a hardcoded password to connect to an application and retrieve addressbook entries:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />obj = new XMLHttpRequest();<br />obj.open('GET','/fetchusers.jsp?id='+form.id.value,'true','scott','tiger');<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who accesses the containing web page will be able to view the password.
