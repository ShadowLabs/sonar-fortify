<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A missing timestamp can leave a SOAP message open to replay attacks.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A Security timestamp indicates a message's freshness. If an attacker intercepts a message retransmits it at a later time, the receiver can reject the replay attack because the timestamp will indicate that the message is stale. Optionally, timestamps can include an expiration attribute which places a hard limit on how long security semantics are valid.<br /><br />To prevent attackers from tampering with timestamps, timestamps should be signed. Without a signed timestamp, it might be possible to intercept a SOAP message, modify the timestamp, and send the message on without the receiver's knowledge. Under these circumstances, an attacker can potentially trick a recipient into accepting a malicious message.<br /><br />The following Apache Axis 2 Rampart configuration omits the <code>Timestamp</code> directive from the <code>&lt;items&gt;</code> tag, so the client does not require responses to have timestamps.<br /><pre><br />&lt;axisconfig name=&quot;AxisJava2.0&quot;&gt;<br />...<br />   &lt;parameter name=&quot;InflowSecurity&quot;&gt;<br />      &lt;action&gt;<br />        &lt;items&gt;Signature Encrypt&lt;/items&gt;<br />...<br />&lt;/axisconfig&gt;<br /></pre>
