<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program uses Android's backup service to save persistent application data to a remote cloud storage.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Android's backup service allows the application to save persistent data to a remote cloud storage in order to provide a restore point for the application data in the future.<br /><br />Android applications can be configured with this backup service by defining the <code>backupAgent</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;application&gt;</code> tag.<br /><br />Android however, does not guarantee the security of your data while using backup, as the cloud storage and transport vary from device to device.
