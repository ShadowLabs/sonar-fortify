<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Functions with inconsistent implementations across operating systems and operating system versions cause portability problems.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The behavior of functions in this category varies by operating system, and at times, even by operating system version. Implementation differences can include:<br /><br />- Slight differences in the way parameters are interpreted leading to inconsistent results.<br /><br />- Some implementations of the function carry significant security risks.<br /><br />- The function might not be defined on all platforms.<br /><p><br />In this case the inconsistent function is <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p>
