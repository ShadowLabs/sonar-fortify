<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The function is obsolete and cannot guarantee that a pointer is valid or referenced memory is safe to use.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  There are a number of reasons not to use the <code>IsBadXXXPtr()</code> class of functions.  These functions are:<br />1) Not thread safe.<br />2) Often implicated in crashes caused by their probing of invalid memory addresses.<br />3) Erroneously believed to carry out proper error handling during exception conditions.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code uses <code>IsBadWritePtr()</code> in an attempt to prevent bad memory writes. <br /><pre><br />if (IsBadWritePtr(ptr, length))<br />{<br />    [handle error]<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br />Programmers often use these functions intending that they will detect exception cases, but the functions usually cause more problems than they fix.
