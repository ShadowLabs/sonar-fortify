<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The application uses a WCF endpoint that relies upon transport mode transfer security. Transport mode is the least secure option and should be avoided.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Transport security specifies that confidentiality, integrity, and authentication are provided by transport-layer mechanisms (such as HTTPS). When using a transport like HTTPS, this mode has the advantage of being efficient in its performance and well understood because of its prevalence on the Internet. The disadvantage is that this kind of security is applied separately on each hop in the communication path, making the communication susceptible to a "man in the middle" attack.<br /><br />WCF offers two other transfer security modes, both of which are preferable: message and transport with message credential. Message security uses the WS-Security specification to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authentication at the message level. This provides end-to-end security and flexibility in transport methods. However, it reduces performance. <br /><br />The final method, transport with message credential, is a hybrid of transport and method. Message security is used to authenticate the client and transport security is used to authenticate the server and provide confidentiality and integrity. It is nearly as efficient as pure transport security.
