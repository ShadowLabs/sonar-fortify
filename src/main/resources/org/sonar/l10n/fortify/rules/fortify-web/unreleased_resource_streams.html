<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br /><p><br />    In this case, there are program paths on which the resource allocated in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not released.<br /></p><br /><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following method never closes the file handle it opens. The <code>finalize()</code> method for <code>FileInputStream</code> eventually calls <code>close()</code>, but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the <code>finalize()</code> method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />private void processFile(String fName) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException<br />{<br />  FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(fName);<br />  int sz;<br />  byte[] byteArray = new byte[BLOCK_SIZE];<br />  while ((sz = fis.read(byteArray)) != -1) {<br />    processBytes(byteArray, sz);<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> Under normal conditions, the following code executes a database query, processes the results returned by the database, and closes the allocated statement object. But if an exception occurs while executing the SQL or processing the results, the statement object will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the database will run out of available cursors and not be able to execute any more SQL queries.<br /><br /><pre><br />  Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();<br />  ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(CXN_SQL);<br />  harvestResults(rs);<br />  stmt.close();<br /></pre>
