<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Empty passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to assign an empty string to a password variable. If the empty password is used to successfully authenticate against another system, then the corresponding account's security is likely compromised because it accepts an empty password. If the empty password is merely a placeholder until a legitimate value can be assigned to the variable, then it can confuse anyone unfamiliar with the code and potentially cause problems on unexpected control flow paths.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case an empty password was found in the call to <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The code below initializes an empty password variable. <br /><pre><br />DECLARE<br />    pwd VARCHAR(20);<br />BEGIN<br />    pwd := "";<br />END;<br /></pre>
