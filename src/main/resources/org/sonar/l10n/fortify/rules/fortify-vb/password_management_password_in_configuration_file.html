<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file may result in a system compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Storing a plaintext password in a configuration file allows anyone who can read the file access to the password-protected resource. Developers sometimes believe that they cannot defend the application from someone who has access to the configuration, but this attitude makes an attacker's job easier. Good password management guidelines require that a password never be stored in plaintext.<br /><br /><p><br />In this case, a hardcoded password exists in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p>
