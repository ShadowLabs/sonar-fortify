<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Persistent session cookies can lead to account compromise.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  A persistent session cookie remains valid even after a user closes his browser and is often used as part of a "Remember Me" feature. Consequently, a persistent session cookie allows users to remain authenticated to an application even after closing their browsers - assuming they didn't explicitly log out. This means the next person that opens the browser will automatically be logged in as the last user. Unless your application is deployed in a controlled environment where users are not allowed to log on from shared machines, it is possible for attackers to compromise your users' accounts even after they've closed their browsers.<br /><p><br />In this case the <code>session.cookie_lifetime</code> property is set to a non-zero number in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following configuration sets the session cookie to expire in 2 hours.<br /><pre><br />session.cookie_lifetime = 7200;<br /></pre>
