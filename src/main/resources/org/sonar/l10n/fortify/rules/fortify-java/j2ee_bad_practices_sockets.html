<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Socket-based communication in web applications is prone to error.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The J2EE standard permits the use of sockets only for the purpose of communication with legacy systems when no higher-level protocol is available. Authoring your own communication protocol requires wrestling with difficult security issues, including: <br /><br />- In-band versus out-of-band signaling<br /><br />- Compatibility between protocol versions<br /><br />- Channel security<br /><br />- Error handling<br /><br />- Network constraints (firewalls)<br /><br />- Session management<br /><br />Without significant scrutiny by a security expert, chances are good that a custom communication protocol will suffer from security problems.<br /><br />Many of the same issues apply to a custom implementation of a standard protocol. While there are usually more resources available that address security concerns related to implementing a standard protocol, these resources are also available to attackers.
