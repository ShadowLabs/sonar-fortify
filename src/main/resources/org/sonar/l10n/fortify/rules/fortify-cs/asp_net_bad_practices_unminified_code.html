<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Unminified JavaScript has been included in this file.  Microsoft recommends that minified versions of JavaScript libraries should be included for performance reasons.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Minification improves page load times for applications that include JavaScript files by reducing the file size. Minification refers to the process of removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, semicolons, braces, shortening the names of local variables and removing unreachable code.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following ASPX code includes the unminified version of Microsoft's jQuery library:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />&lt;script src="http://applicationserver.application.com/lib/jquery/jquery-1.4.2.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />...<br /></pre>
