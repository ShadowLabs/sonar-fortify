<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The lack of a proper audit trail after a security incident can hamper forensic efforts.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) offers the ability to log successful and/or failed authentication attempts. Logging failed authentication attempts can warn administrators of potential brute force attacks. Similarly, logging successful authentication events can provide a useful audit trail when a legitimate account is compromised.<br /><p><br />In this case, <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> does not contain a <code>&lt;serviceSecurityAudit&gt;</code> tag.<br /></p>
