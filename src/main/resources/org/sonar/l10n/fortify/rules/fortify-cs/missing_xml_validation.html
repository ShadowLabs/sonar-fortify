<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Failure to enable validation when parsing XML gives an attacker the opportunity to supply malicious input.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Most successful attacks begin with a violation of the programmer's assumptions. By accepting an XML document without validating it against a DTD or XML schema, the programmer leaves a door open for attackers to provide unexpected, unreasonable, or malicious input. It is not possible for an XML parser to validate all aspects of a document's content; a parser cannot understand the complete semantics of the data. However, a parser can do a complete and thorough job of checking the document's structure and therefore guarantee to the code that processes the document that the content is well-formed.<br /><p><br />In this case, the method <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/> is called to create an <code>XmlReader</code>, but schema validation is not enabled since the method does not take an <code>XmlReaderSettings</code> object.<br /></p>
