<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The elevated privilege level required to perform operations such as <code>chroot()</code> should be dropped immediately after the operation is performed.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  When a program calls a privileged function, such as <code>chroot()</code>, it must first acquire <code>root</code> privilege. As soon as the privileged operation has completed, the program should drop <code>root</code> privilege and return to the privilege level of the invoking user. <br /><p><br />In this case the privileged function that is used without subsequently dropping privileges is <Replace key="FirstTransitionFunction" link="FirstTraceLocation"/> in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code calls <code>chroot()</code> to restrict the application to a subset of the filesystem below <code>APP_HOME</code> in order to prevent an attacker from using the program to gain unauthorized access to files located elsewhere. The code then opens a file specified by the user and processes the contents of the file. <br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />chroot(APP_HOME);<br />chdir("/");<br /><br />FILE* data = fopen(argv[1], "r+"); <br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />Constraining the process inside the application's home directory before opening any files is a valuable security measure. However, the absence of a call to <code>setuid()</code> with some non-zero value means the application is continuing to operate with unnecessary <code>root</code> privileges. Any successful exploit carried out by an attacker against the application can now result in a privilege escalation attack because any malicious operations will be performed with the privileges of the superuser. If the application drops to the privilege level of a non-<code>root</code> user, the potential for damage is substantially reduced.
