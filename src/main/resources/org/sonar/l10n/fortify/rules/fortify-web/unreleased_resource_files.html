<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a file handle.<br /><p><br />    In this case, there are program paths on which the file handle resource obtained in <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> is not released.<br /></p><br /><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service attack by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following method never closes the file handle it opens. The <code>finalize()</code> method for <code>ZipFile</code> eventually calls <code>close()</code>, but there is no guarantee as to how long it will take before the <code>finalize()</code> method will be invoked. In a busy environment, this can result in the JVM using up all of its file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />public void printZipContents(String fName)<br />    throws ZipException, IOException, SecurityException, IllegalStateException, NoSuchElementException<br />{<br />  ZipFile zf = new ZipFile(fName);<br />  Enumeration&lt;ZipEntry&gt; e = zf.entries();<br /><br />  while (e.hasMoreElements()) {<br />    printFileInfo(e.nextElement());<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br /><br /><b>Example 2:</b> Under normal conditions, the following fix properly closes the file handle after printing out all the zip file entries. But if an exception occurs while iterating through the entries, the zip file handle will not be closed. If this happens often enough, the JVM can still run out of available file handles.<br /><br /><pre><br />public void printZipContents(String fName)<br />    throws ZipException, IOException, SecurityException, IllegalStateException, NoSuchElementException<br />{<br />  ZipFile zf = new ZipFile(fName);<br />  Enumeration&lt;ZipEntry&gt; e = zf.entries();<br /><br />  while (e.hasMoreElements()) {<br />    printFileInfo(e.nextElement());<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre>
