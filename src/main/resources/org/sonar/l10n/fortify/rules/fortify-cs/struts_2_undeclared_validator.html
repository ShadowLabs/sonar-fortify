<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  A validator referenced in ActionClass-validation.xml is not declared in validators.xml
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Struts2 requires that custom validators be defined in <code>validators.xml</code> before being used in a Action validator definition. Missing validator definitions are an indication that validation is not up to date.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following Action validator was not defined in <code>validators.xml</code>.<br /><pre><br />&lt;validators&gt;<br />    &lt;validator name="required" class="com.opensymphony.xwork2.validator.validators.RequiredFieldValidator"/&gt;<br />&lt;/validators&gt;<br /></pre>	<br /><br />It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the rest of the application. Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.
