<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Multiple Struts2 field validator references with the same name exist. Duplicate validator references are an indication that validation is not up to date.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  More than one field validator definition with the same name exist in <code>ActionClass-validation.xml</code>. Duplicate validation definitions with the same name may result in unexpected behavior.<br /><br />	    <b>Example:</b> The following entry shows two duplicate field validator definitions.<br /><br />    <pre><br />   &lt;field name="emailField"&gt;<br />      &lt;field-validator type="email" short-circuit="true"&gt;<br />          &lt;message&gt;You must enter a value for email.&lt;/message&gt;<br />      &lt;/field-validator&gt;<br />      &lt;field-validator type="email" short-circuit="true"&gt;<br />          &lt;message&gt;Not a valid e-mail.&lt;/message&gt;<br />      &lt;/field-validator&gt;<br />  &lt;/field&gt;<br />  </pre><br />	 <br />It is critically important that validation logic be maintained and kept in sync with the rest of the application. Unchecked input is the root cause of some of today's worst and most common software security problems. Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and process control vulnerabilities all stem from incomplete or absent input validation. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.
