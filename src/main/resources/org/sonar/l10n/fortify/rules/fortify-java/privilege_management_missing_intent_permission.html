<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program attempts to perform an operation without requesting the required permission.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  Certain Android operations require permissions.  Permissions have to be requested by the application at install time by listing them in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file via <code>&lt;uses-permission/&gt;</code> tags. If the required permissions are not requested, the operations that require these permissions will fail at runtime. In some cases, a <code>java.lang.SecurityException</code> is thrown back to the application. Other times, operations fail silently without an exception.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code sends an intent with the <code>android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED</code> action.<br /><br /><pre><br />    Intent i = new Intent("android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED");<br />    context.sendBroadcast(i);<br /></pre><br /><br />Sending this intent requires the <code>android.permission.BROADCAST_SMS</code> permission. If this permission is not requested by the application in the manifest file, the application will fail to send the intent.
