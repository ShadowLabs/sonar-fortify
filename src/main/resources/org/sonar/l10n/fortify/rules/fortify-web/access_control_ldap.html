<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Executing an LDAP statement that contains a user-controlled value outside the filter string can allow an attacker to alter the statement's meaning or execute arbitrary LDAP commands.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  LDAP manipulation errors occur when:<br /><br />1.	Data enters a program from an untrusted source.<br /><p><br />In this case the data enters at <Replace key="SourceFunction" link="SourceLocation"/> in <Replace key="SourceLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SourceLocation.line"/>. <br /></p><br />2.	The data is used outside the filter string in a dynamic LDAP statement. <br /><p><br />In this case the data is used by <Replace key="SinkFunction" link="SinkLocation"/> in <Replace key="SinkLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="SinkLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code reads a username and password from an HTTP request and uses it to perform an LDAP lookup. <br /><br /><pre><br />env.put(Context.SECURITY_AUTHENTICATION, "none");<br />DirContext ctx = new InitialDirContext(env);<br /><br />String empID = request.getParameter("empID");<br /><br />try<br />{<br />  BasicAttribute attr = new BasicAttribute("empID", empID);<br /><br />  NamingEnumeration employee = <br />            ctx.search("ou=People,dc=example,dc=com",attr);  <br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />Because the query includes user input and is performed under an anonymous bind, the query will return the details for any username specified, regardless of whether it matches the specified password. An attacker can effectively use the code below to lookup the details of any employee in the system, representing a serious privacy violation. The problem is that the developer failed to leverage the appropriate access control mechanisms necessary to restrict the query to access only employee records the current user is permitted to read.
