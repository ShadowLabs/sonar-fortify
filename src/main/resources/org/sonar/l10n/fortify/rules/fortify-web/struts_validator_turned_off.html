<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  This action form mapping disables the form's <code>validate()</code> method.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  An action form mapping should never disable validation. Disabling validation disables the Struts Validator as well as any custom validation logic performed by the form.<br /><br /><b>Example:</b> An action form mapping that disables validation.<br />  <br /><pre><br />&lt;action path="/download"<br />type="com.website.d2.action.DownloadAction"<br />name="downloadForm"<br />scope="request"<br />input=".download"<br />validate="false"&gt;<br />&lt;/action&gt;<br /></pre><br /><br />Disabling validation exposes this action to numerous types of attacks. Unchecked input is the root cause of vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, process control, and SQL injection. Although J2EE applications are not generally susceptible to memory corruption attacks, if a J2EE application interfaces with native code that does not perform array bounds checking, an attacker may be able to use an input validation mistake in the J2EE application to launch a buffer overflow attack.
