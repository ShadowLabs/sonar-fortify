<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Hardcoded passwords can compromise system security in a way that cannot be easily remedied.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  It is never a good idea to hardcode a password. Not only does hardcoding a password allow all of the project's developers to view the password, it also makes fixing the problem extremely difficult. Once the code is in production, the password cannot be changed without patching the software. If the account protected by the password is compromised, the owners of the system will be forced to choose between security and availability.<br /><p><br />In this case a hardcoded password was found in the call to <Replace key="PrimaryCall.name" link="PrimaryLocation"/> in <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.file"/> at line <Replace key="PrimaryLocation.line"/>.<br /></p><br /><br /><b>Example:</b> The following code sets default authentication credentials for URL requests, supplying a hardcoded string for a password:<br /><br /><pre><br />...<br />URLRequestDefaults.setLoginCredentialsForHost(hostname, "scott", "tiger");<br />...<br /></pre><br /><br />This code will run successfully, but anyone who has access to it will have access to the password. Once the program has shipped, there is no going back from the user "scott" with a password of "tiger" unless the program is patched. A devious employee with access to this information can use it to break into the system. Even worse, if attackers have access to the binary for the application they can use one of many publicly available decompilers to access the disassembled code, which will contain the values of the passwords used.
