<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  The program fails to release a lock it holds, which might lead to deadlock.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  The program can potentially fail to release a system resource.<br /><p><br />There are program paths on which the resource locked between <Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.file"/>:<Replace key="FirstTraceLocation.line"/> and <Replace key="LastTraceLocation.file"/>:<Replace key="LastTraceLocation.line"/> is not always unlocked.<br /></p><br />Resource leaks have at least two common causes:<br /><br />- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.<br /><br />- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for releasing the resource.<br /><br />Most unreleased resource issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a resource leak, the attacker might be able to launch a denial of service by depleting the resource pool.<br /><br /><b>Example 1:</b> The following code establishes a lock before <code>performOperationInCriticalSection()</code>, but fails to release the lock if an exception is thrown in that method.<br /><br /><pre><br />Object synchronizationObject = new Object ();<br /><br />System.Threading.Monitor.Enter(synchronizationObject);<br />performOperationInCriticalSection();<br />System.Threading.Monitor.Exit(synchronizationObject);<br /></pre>
