<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>
  Explicit requests for garbage collection are a bellwether indicating likely performance problems.
</p>
<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
<p>
  At some point in every Java developer's career, a problem surfaces that appears to be so mysterious, impenetrable, and impervious to debugging that there seems to be no alternative but to blame the garbage collector. Especially when the bug is related to time and state, there may be a hint of empirical evidence to support this theory: inserting a call to <code>System.gc()</code> sometimes seems to make the problem go away.<br /><br />In almost every case we have seen, calling <code>System.gc()</code> is the wrong thing to do. In fact, calling <code>System.gc()</code> can cause performance problems if it is invoked too often.
