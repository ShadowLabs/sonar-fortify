							<p>
							  If a <code>ThreadDeath</code> error is not re-thrown, the thread in question might not actually die.
							</p>
							<h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
							<p>
							  <code>ThreadDeath</code> errors should only be caught if an applications needs to clean up after being terminated asynchronously. If a <code>ThreadDeath</code> error is caught, it is important that it be re-thrown so that the thread actually dies. The purpose of throwing <code>ThreadDeath</code> is to stop a thread. If <code>ThreadDeath</code> is swallowed, it can prevent a thread from stopping and result in unexpected behavior since whoever originally threw <code>ThreadDeath</code> expects the thread to stop.<br>                <br><b>Example 1:</b> The following code catches <code>ThreadDeath</code> but does not re-throw it.<br><pre><br>try<br>{<br>//some code<br>}<br>catch(ThreadDeath td)<br>{<br>//clean up code   <br>}<br></pre>
